{"text":"The worst air in Europe is found in central and eastern countries, as well as in Italy, but a Guardian investigation in September found that 98% of Europeans breathe air so dirty it breaches WHO limits. The European Council has proposed that countries with a high share of low-income households and a GDP per person below the EU average should be allowed to hit limit values as late as 2040, because they have less money to invest in cleaning up. Many poorer European countries have dirty air because they stoke power plants with more coal to make electricity, burn more wood and coal to heat homes, and have older cars and factories. The scientists said that \u201cusing poverty as an excuse to fail to act is the exact opposite of what these countries need\u201d. It would be better for human health in these countries to set laws and provide money to speed up \u201curgently needed\u201d clean air policies, they added. \u201cWe need fair and ambitious new EU air quality legislation that values the health of all Europeans equally,\u201d said Zorana Jovanovic Andersen, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Copenhagen and chair of the ERS environment and health committee. \u201cChildren and adults in eastern European countries have already been breathing the most polluted air in Europe \u2013 and suffering from related lung diseases \u2013 for far too long.\u201d Bad air hurts economies because it means people take more sick days off work and need more treatment in hospital. An impact assessment from the European Commission found that fully meeting the WHO guidelines by 2030 would deliver the greatest net economic benefit of the three scenarios it considered, with savings of \u20ac38bn (\u00a332bn) a year. The financial implications were relevant, said Margherita Tolotto from the campaign group the European Environmental

The European Council has proposed that countries with a high share of low-income households and a GDP per person below the EU average should be allowed to hit limit values as late as 2040, because they have less money to invest in cleaning up. Many poorer European countries have dirty air because they stoke power plants with more coal to make electricity, burn more wood and coal to heat homes, and have older cars and factories. The scientists said that \u201cusing poverty as an excuse to fail to act is the exact opposite of what these countries need\u201d.

{"text":"It will begin with a study in Italy of how to include bears in policy formulation by human communities. There are plans for similar projects to represent elephants in Kenya and whales in the ocean. One of the cornerstones of its work, according to the founder, Melanie Challenger, is that participants should listen to the animals in question, rather than present themselves as experts. \u201cIt is more than just a scholarly and policy-based approach; it is a philosophy and a practice,\u201d said Challenger, who is also a vice-president of the RSPCA and author of How to Be Animal. She said ideas about political representation for animals moved into the public realm in 2023 with articles being published and talks given to animal charities, Earth governance experts and sustainability groups. \u201cWe feared scepticism and, instead, have been met with enthusiasm and, in some ways, relief.

Flanked by green banners bearing the word \u201ccourage\u201d, the two MEPs, who were elected by delegates at a congress in Lyon on Saturday, said they would stand up to the surge of the far right and fight for a more equal and ecological Europe. Reintke, a German MEP who won 55% of the vote for lead female candidate, said she wanted to put social justice at the heart of the election campaign. She said: \u201cI want us to speak to people who we are not yet speaking to.\u201d Eickhout, a Dutch MEP who won 57% of the vote for the second position, said he wanted to be an antidote to the far right. \u201cWe will stand for democracy, we will fight the fascists, and we will stand for your future.\u201d The Greens rode a wave of public support at the last elections in 2019 after students staged protests for climate action and a UN report found countries must hit net zero emissions by 2050 to keep the planet from heating 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F).As far-right parties have grown more popular, and the Greens have lost support in big countries such as Germany, delegates at the congress said they expected to shed some seats in the European parliament. Eickhout and Reintke \u2013 who have been MEPs since 2009 and 2014 respectively \u2013 told the Guardian they expected to outperform the polls but that it would be harder than at the previous

{"text":"In September, Sunak rowed back on key climate policies, including postponing the phase-out of sales of new fossil fuel vehicles, and announced fresh licences for North Sea oil and gas, which were greeted with international dismay. At Cop28, the UK argued for the phase-out of fossil fuels, but at home Sunak was insisting that oil and gas would have a central role in UK energy for decades. The government also gave the green light to a new coalmine, while other countries were being urged to give up coal. Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cThe UK government wears its hypocrisy on its sleeve when it comes to climate policy, and this new report from the CCC really spells it out. Our climate is on a knife-edge, and there must be no more empty words or hollow promises. The government must immediately end new oil and gas production and tax fossil fuel companies more to generate new public finance for climate action both at home and abroad. Only then can the UK begin to credibly claim it is a global climate leader.\u201d Carla Denyer, co-leader of the Green party, said: \u201cThrough its drive to \u2018max out\u2019 on North Sea fossil fuels, the UK government has blown any pretence of global leadership on tackling the climate crisis. We need to call time on all new licences for fossil fuel exploration, accelerate the move towards renewable energy and implement a large scale home insulation programme. That is how the UK can show climate

At Cop28, the UK argued for the phase-out of fossil fuels, but at home Sunak was insisting that oil and gas would have a central role in UK energy for decades. The government also gave the green light to a new coalmine, while other countries were being urged to give up coal. Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cThe UK government wears its hypocrisy on its sleeve when it comes to climate policy, and this new report from the CCC really spells it out. Our climate is on a knife-edge, and there must be no more empty words or hollow promises. The government must immediately end new oil and gas production and tax fossil fuel companies more to generate new public finance for climate action both at home and abroad. Only then can the UK begin to credibly claim it is a global climate leader.\u201d Carla Denyer, co-leader of the Green party, said: \u201cThrough its drive to \u2018max out\u2019 on North Sea fossil fuels, the UK government has blown any pretence of global leadership on tackling the climate crisis.

{"text":"I ended up walking around with three little frogs in my bag for a year, preserved in alcohol in a jar. I would take them to meetings with me, and ask people if they had ever seen them before. Then I met a taxonomist from S\u00e3o Paulo who took one look at them and said it was a new species. Not only was it a new species, it turned out to be a very rare and special frog. The entire species lives within 0.5 sq km on a patch of land 1,800 metres above sea level. These frogs spend their entire lifecycle inside the plant: they lay their eggs, become tadpoles and do everything inside it. I officially described the species as Crossodactylodes itambe in 2013, four years after I found it. I decided to focus my research on this frog, and work to save it. I never thought I would spend my career learning about frogs, but It feels like an obligation to finish this work and make sure they are protected. I hope to inspire others to do the same, to spend their whole life researching one single species and make something of it \u2013 because by protecting one species I am protecting a whole

Not only was it a new species, it turned out to be a very rare and special frog. The entire species lives within 0.5 sq km on a patch of land 1,800 metres above sea level. These frogs spend their entire lifecycle inside the plant: they lay their eggs, become tadpoles and do everything inside it. I officially described the species as Crossodactylodes itambe in 2013, four years after I found it. I decided to focus my research on this frog, and work to save it.

At Cop29, one of the key issues is likely to be climate finance, as poor countries struggle to find the funding they need to invest in clean energy and move away from fossil fuels. Babayev called on the private sector to step up with funding for a green transition in the developing world, as well as publicly funded banks such as the World Bank. \u201cOur task is to invite as much as possible the private sector for climate finance \u2013 it\u2019s a very good source for new initiatives, new formats, new mechanisms for finance,\u201d he said. Cop29 will take place at the end of what is likely to be another year of record-breaking temperatures around the world. Last month marked the first time average global temperatures for a whole year had exceeded the vital scientific threshold of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. One year of such heights is not enough to invalidate the Paris agreement, under which countries aspire to hold temperatures within the 1.5C limit, but scientists are increasingly pessimistic, as global emissions have not yet started to fall as they need to, and rapidly.

One year of such heights is not enough to invalidate the Paris agreement, under which countries aspire to hold temperatures within the 1.5C limit, but scientists are increasingly pessimistic, as global emissions have not yet started to fall as they need to, and rapidly.

{"text":"Over the past six years, Van Aswegen has calculated the length, width and body mass of more than 7,500 whales, following them from the breeding grounds in Hawaii to their feeding grounds in south-east Alaska. He uses the Happywhale database to identify the whales he measures. The lack of food resources during the marine heatwave \u201cultimately resulted in reproductive failure in 2018\u201d, says Van Aswegen. Only three humpback calves made it from Hawaii to Alaska, and by the end of the feeding season all three were missing. During a shorter marine heatwave that blasted the north-east Pacific in 2021, Van Aswegen found that, on average, the 24 females with calves lost weight over the feeding season, when typically, these mothers would gain about 16kg a day. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen lactating females actually lose weight on the feeding grounds,\u201d says Van Aswegen. Long-term monitoring efforts such as the drone-based humpback measurements and the collaborative collection of tail fluke images through Happywhale \u201care absolutely critical because they allow us to look at the effects of large-scale oceanographic events\u201d, says Lars Bejder, the director of the Marine Mammal Research Program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and a co-author on the recent study. \u201cThese animals are truly sentinels of the ocean. Healthy oceans make healthy whales and vice versa.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news

He uses the Happywhale database to identify the whales he measures. The lack of food resources during the marine heatwave \u201cultimately resulted in reproductive failure in 2018\u201d, says Van Aswegen. Only three humpback calves made it from Hawaii to Alaska, and by the end of the feeding season all three were missing. During a shorter marine heatwave that blasted the north-east Pacific in 2021, Van Aswegen found that, on average, the 24 females with calves lost weight over the feeding season, when typically, these mothers would gain about 16kg a day. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen lactating females actually lose weight on the feeding grounds,\u201d says Van Aswegen. Long-term monitoring efforts such as the drone-based humpback measurements and the collaborative collection of tail fluke images through Happywhale \u201care absolutely critical because they allow us to look at the effects of large-scale oceanographic events\u201d, says Lars Bejder, the director of the Marine Mammal Research Program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and a co-author on the recent study. \u201cThese animals are truly sentinels of the ocean.

{"text":"The rules that are to be kicked back until 2025 require farmers to set aside at least 4% of their land for non-productive purposes, or for hedgerows and trees, in order to keep getting subsidies from the EU. Critics say the decision to delay them has less to do with substance of the policy and more to do with appeasing a key voter base. The commission has already delayed the rules once, after Russia invaded Ukraine and threw grain supplies into chaos, because farmers argued they would hurt food security. But now, as the war\u2019s second anniversary nears, cheap grain from Ukraine is one of the main sources of the farmers\u2019 frustration. \u201cSo basically, whether we have too much or too little, the solution is always to destroy nature and intensify production,\u201d said Ariel Brunner, the director of Bird Life Europe. \u201cThe justification is openly hypocritical.\u201d So far, farmers have been the most vocal group protesting against Europe\u2019s climate policies, and governments have been eager to signal support for them \u2013 particularly in rural areas that are bleeding votes to far-right parties. The appeasement has led to accusations of hypocrisy in countries such as Germany, where politicians who have criticised climate activists for glueing themselves to roads have cheered on farmers for blocking traffic with their tractors. Analysts are divided over whether this \u201cgreenlash\u201d against climate policy will spill into other sectors and gain widespread support from the public. In recent European elections, such as in the Netherlands and Poland, anti-environment policies played a small role on the campaign trail behind issues such as migration and

The commission has already delayed the rules once, after Russia invaded Ukraine and threw grain supplies into chaos, because farmers argued they would hurt food security.

Analysts are divided over whether this \u201cgreenlash\u201d against climate policy will spill into other sectors and gain widespread support from the public.

{"text":"That is why the second avenue of \u201cdoing something\u201d, composed of \u201cthe rest of us\u201d, is so important. Chaudhary advocates for \u201cleftwing climate realism\u201d, which accepts the science, not because it\u2019s a discipline \u201cbeyond impugning\u201d but because it\u2019s quite clear that there are ecological limits on this planet. We need a slower life, he argues; a circular economic system, where firms compete for the same amount of finite profit and the state dominates certain sectors. This will be good for the planet and for people, producing \u201ca world relieved from social, economic, and ecological despair and exhaustion\u201d. So how do we get on this \u201cfaster [\u2026] track to a slower life?\u201d Answering this question is one of the other main aims of Exhausted of the Earth. Chaudhary deploys a version of realism informed by thinkers such as Franzt Fanon (the title pays homage to Fanon\u2019s classic, The Wretched of the Earth, on the trauma of colonisation), Audre Lorde and philosopher Raymond Geuss.

Now, a wide variety of rice species are held by SNRI/ADRON, which has teamed up with the Crop Trust, a non-profit organisation dedicated to safeguarding crop diversity by collecting and protecting seeds.

{"text":"Women are hit harder than men by the climate crisis in part because the impacts exacerbate existing inequalities, such as unequal rights to land tenure and a lack of economic opportunities for women. Women also tend to bear more of the burden of providing water, fuel and food. Governments and donors could address these problems with better targeting of assistance, Phillips said. \u201cTargeting women in ways that ensure their empowerment has greater benefits,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are multiple gains and benefits from targeting climate finance at women. We need to intentionally focus on this, to get much higher returns on investment.\u201d The researchers analysed socioeconomic data from more than 100,000 rural households, representing more than 950 million people, across 24 low- and middle-income countries. They cross-referenced this with 70 years of daily precipitation and temperature data to build a detailed picture of how changes to the climate and extreme weather affected people\u2019s incomes, labour and lives. It adds to a growing body of research that shows women and vulnerable people suffer disproportionately from the impacts of the climate crisis. The report also found that older people tended to be more affected than the young, who may have more opportunities to move to escape the impacts of extreme weather, and the already poor were more vulnerable than those on higher

We need to intentionally focus on this, to get much higher returns on investment.\u201d The researchers analysed socioeconomic data from more than 100,000 rural households, representing more than 950 million people, across 24 low- and middle-income countries.

It adds to a growing body of research that shows women and vulnerable people suffer disproportionately from the impacts of the climate crisis. The report also found that older people tended to be more affected than the young, who may have more opportunities to move to escape the impacts of extreme weather, and the already poor were more vulnerable than those on higher incomes.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: targeting women in ways that ensure their empowerment\npolicy: \ntechnology: climate finance, extreme weather"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710526632,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24","_session_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24"}
{"text":"Future projects Conservation scientists have identified a range of issues that will need careful evidence-based responses in coming years. \u2022 Earthworms play a key role in soil fertility and nutrient recycling. Studies suggest their numbers are now declining dramatically in the UK, and populations need to be restored. \u2022 Numerous plans have been put forward to use oceans to absorb increased amounts of carbon dioxide, including plans to intensify algal growth by using fertilisers. But their global impacts must be properly assessed. \u2022 Incidents of wildfires and biomass burning are expected to become more frequent as the world heats up.

{"text":"Proposed delays to EU air pollution limits will mean hundreds of thousands more people dying early and will \u201cwiden the inequality gap\u201d between eastern and western Europe, a group of public health experts have said, as EU negotiators thrash out key rules to clean up the air. The World Health Organization has set guidelines for how many tiny particles and how much toxic gas can dirty the air, but stressed that no level of pollution is safe to breathe. Doctors writing in the International Journal of Public Health want the limits met by the end of the decade, but the European parliament wants to wait till 2035, the European Commission wants to set weaker limits for 2030 without setting a date to align with the WHO, and the European Council wants to let poorer countries wait till 2040. \u201cEvery year of delay of reaching limit values directly translates into more death and disease,\u201d said Barbara Hoffman, the chair of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) advocacy council and head of environmental epidemiology at Heinrich Heine University in D\u00fcsseldorf. Hoffman and colleagues from several public health institutes found that 330,000 more people would die early if EU member states with fine particulate levels greater than 10 micrograms per cubic metre were to delay bringing their pollution down to that level by a decade from 2030 to 2040. The WHO limit is 5 micrograms per cubic metre. \u201cThese numbers make it clear that allowing delays will impose a substantial, unjust and unacceptable loss of human lives in Europe,\u201d the scientists wrote. Doctors call bad air an invisible killer. Each breath a person takes draws in pollutants small enough to seep from the lungs into the bloodstream.

The World Health Organization has set guidelines for how many tiny particles and how much toxic gas can dirty the air, but stressed that no level of pollution is safe to breathe. Doctors writing in the International Journal of Public Health want the limits met by the end of the decade, but the European parliament wants to wait till 2035, the European Commission wants to set weaker limits for 2030 without setting a date to align with the WHO, and the European Council wants to let poorer countries wait till 2040. \u201cEvery year of delay of reaching limit values directly translates into more death and disease,\u201d said Barbara Hoffman, the chair of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) advocacy council and head of environmental epidemiology at Heinrich Heine University in D\u00fcsseldorf. Hoffman and colleagues from several public health institutes found that 330,000 more people would die early if EU member states with fine particulate levels greater than 10 micrograms per cubic metre were to delay bringing their pollution down to that level by a decade from 2030 to 2040. The WHO limit is 5 micrograms per cubic metre. \u201cThese numbers make it clear that allowing delays will impose a substantial, unjust and unacceptable loss of human lives in Europe,\u201d the scientists wrote. Doctors call bad air an invisible killer. Each breath a person takes draws in pollutants small enough to seep from the lungs into the bloodstream. Once in the blood, they flow through the body, hurting the organs.\n'''"],"response":["project: EU air pollution limits\ninitiative: clean up the air\npolicy: Kigali Amendment on HFCs\ntechnology: air pollution limits, tiny particles, toxic gas, fine particulate levels"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710526699,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24","_session_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24"}
{"text":"On the current trend of increased energy demands, energy production from non-fossil sources would need to grow by more than 11% a year to meet the 2025 target. Currently, renewable energy production is increasing by an annual rate of 8.5%. Clean energy contributed $1.6tn (\u00a31.26tn) to China\u2019s economy in 2023, accounting for all of the growth in investment. And on the target of reducing the carbon intensity of China\u2019s economy by 18% by 2025, China has so far managed only a 5% reduction since 2020. That means that CO2 emissions will have to come down in absolute terms from 2023 to 2025 to meet the target. According to the National Energy Administration, China\u2019s installed capacity of renewable energy exceeded 1.45bn kilowatts in 2023, accounting for more than half of the country\u2019s total installed power generation capacity. But a separate report published on Thursday by CREA and Global Energy Monitor found that China approved 114 gigawatts (GW) of coal power in 2023, up from 104 GW in 2022. China\u2019s share of global coal emissions surpassed 64% in 2023. Since Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, pledged to \u201cstrictly control\u201d new coal power in 2021, the approval of new coal has actually increased rapidly. Nearly half of the growth in power generation between 2020 and 2023 came from coal.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/22/growth-in-co2-emissions-leaves-china-likely-to-miss-climate-targets_2","publication_date":"2024-02-22T00:01:37Z"},"_input_hash":-695661111,"_task_hash":529476484,"tokens":[{"text":"On","start":0,"end":2,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":3,"end":6,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"current","start":7,"end":14,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"trend","start":15,"end":20,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":21,"end":23,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"increased","start":24,"end":33,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"energy","start":34,"end":40,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"demands","start":41,"end":48,"id":7,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":48,"end":49,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"energy","start":50,"end":56,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"production","start":57,"end":67,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"from","start":68,"end":72,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"non","start":73,"end":76,"id":12,"ws":false},{"text":"-","start":76,"end":77,"id":13,"ws":false},{"text":"fossil","start":77,"end":83,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"sources","start":84,"end":91,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"would","start":92,"end":97,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"need","start":98,"end":102,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":103,"end":105,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"grow","start":106,"end":110,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":111,"end":113,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"more","start":114,"end":118,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"than","start":119,"end":123,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"11","start":124,"end":126,"id":23,"ws":false},{"text":"%","start":126,"end":127,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":128,"end":129,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"year","start":130,"end":134,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":135,"end":137,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"meet","start":138,"end":142,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":143,"end":146,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"2025","start":147,"end":151,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"target","start":152,"end":158,"id":31,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":158,"end":159,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"Currently","start":160,"end":169,"id":33,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":169,"end":170,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"renewable","start":171,"end":180,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"energy","start":181,"end":187,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"production","start":188,"end":198,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":199,"end":201,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"increasing","start":202,"end":212,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":213,"end":215,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"an","start":216,"end":218,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"annual","start":219,"end":225,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"rate","start":226,"end":230,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":231,"end":233,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"8.5","start":234,"end":237,"id":45,"ws":false},{"text":"%","start":237,"end":238,"id":46,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":238,"end":239,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"Clean","start":240,"end":245,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"energy","start":246,"end":252,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"contributed","start":253,"end":264,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"$","start":265,"end":266,"id":51,"ws":false},{"text":"1.6tn","start":266,"end":271,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":272,"end":273,"id":53,"ws":false},{"text":"\u00a3","start":273,"end":274,"id":54,"ws":false},{"text":"1.26tn","start":274,"end":280,"id":55,"ws":false},{"text":")","start":280,"end":281,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":282,"end":284,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"China","start":285,"end":290,"id":58,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":290,"end":292,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"economy","start":293,"end":300,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":301,"end":303,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"2023","start":304,"end":308,"id":62,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":308,"end":309,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"accounting","start":310,"end":320,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":321,"end":324,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"all","start":325,"end":328,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":329,"end":331,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":332,"end":335,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"growth","start":336,"end":342,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":343,"end":345,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"investment","start":346,"end":356,"id":71,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":356,"end":357,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"And","start":358,"end":361,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":362,"end":364,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":365,"end":368,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"target","start":369,"end":375,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":376,"end":378,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"reducing","start":379,"end":387,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":388,"end":391,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"carbon","start":392,"end":398,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"intensity","start":399,"end":408,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":409,"end":411,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"China","start":412,"end":417,"id":83,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":417,"end":419,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"economy","start":420,"

Clean energy contributed $1.6tn (\u00a31.26tn) to China\u2019s economy in 2023, accounting for all of the growth in investment. And on the target of reducing the carbon intensity of China\u2019s economy by 18% by 2025, China has so far managed only a 5% reduction since 2020. That means that CO2 emissions will have to come down in absolute terms from 2023 to 2025 to meet the target. According to the National Energy Administration, China\u2019s installed capacity of renewable energy exceeded 1.45bn kilowatts in 2023, accounting for more than half of the country\u2019s total installed power generation capacity. But a separate report published on Thursday by CREA and Global Energy Monitor found that China approved 114 gigawatts (GW) of coal power in 2023, up from 104 GW in 2022. China\u2019s share of global coal emissions surpassed 64% in 2023. Since Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, pledged to \u201cstrictly control\u201d new coal power in 2021, the approval of new coal has actually increased rapidly. Nearly half of the growth in power generation between 2020 and 2023 came from coal.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: reducing the carbon intensity of China\u2019s economy\npolicy: \ntechnology: renewable energy, clean energy, CO2 emissions, coal power, coal emissions"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710526739,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24","_session_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24"}

{"text":"Last year was the hottest ever reliably recorded globally by a blistering margin, US scientists have confirmed, leaving researchers struggling to account for the severity of the heat and what it portends for the unfolding climate crisis. Last year was the world\u2019s hottest in records that stretch back to 1850, according to analyses released concurrently by Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) on Friday, with a record high in ocean temperatures and a new low in Antarctic sea ice extent. Noaa calculated that last year\u2019s global temperature was 1.35C (2.4F) hotter, on average, than the pre-industrial era, which is slightly less than the 1.48C (2.6F) increase that EU scientists, who also found 2023 was the hottest on record, came up with due to slightly different methodologies. A separate analysis of 2023 released on Friday by Berkeley Earth has the year at 1.54C above pre-industrial times, which is above the 1.5C (2.7F) warming limit that countries have agreed to keep to in order to avoid disastrous global heating impacts. This guardrail will need to be broken on a consistent basis, rather than one year, to be considered fully breached, however. The burning of fossil fuels and deforestation has driven the extraordinary warmth, which follows a string of hotter-than-average years in recent decades. Each decade over the past 40 years has been warmer than the last, Noaa said, with the most recent 10 years all making up the hottest 10 years ever recorded. Last year\u2019s record heat was further spurred by El Ni\u00f1o, a periodic climatic event that heats up parts of the Pacific Ocean and heightens global temperatures. However, even with these known factors scientists were left stunned at the severity of 2023, which was initially following the expected long-term warming pattern before seeing record after record obliterated in the second half of the year.

Last year was the world\u2019s hottest in records that stretch back to 1850, according to analyses released concurrently by Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) on Friday, with a record high in ocean temperatures and a new low in Antarctic sea ice extent. Noaa calculated that last year\u2019s global temperature was 1.35C (2.4F) hotter, on average, than the pre-industrial era, which is slightly less than the 1.48C (2.6F) increase that EU scientists, who also found 2023 was the hottest on record, came up with due to slightly different methodologies. A separate analysis of 2023 released on Friday by Berkeley Earth has the year at 1.54C above pre-industrial times, which is above the 1.5C (2.7F) warming limit that countries have agreed to keep to in order to avoid disastrous global heating impacts. This guardrail will need to be broken on a consistent basis, rather than one year, to be considered fully breached, however. The burning of fossil fuels and deforestation has driven the extraordinary warmth, which follows a string of hotter-than-average years in recent decades. Each decade over the past 40 years has been warmer than the last, Noaa said, with the most recent 10 years all making up the hottest 10 years ever recorded. Last year\u2019s record heat was further spurred by El Ni\u00f1o, a periodic climatic event that heats up parts of the Pacific Ocean and heightens global temperatures. However, even with these known factors scientists were left stunned at the severity of 2023, which was initially following the expected long-term warming pattern before seeing record after record obliterated in the second half of the year. Last year beat the previous temperature record, set in 2016, by 0.15C (0.27F), Noaa said, which is a huge margin in climate terms.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: fossil fuels, deforestation, El Ni\u00f1o, Pacific Ocean"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710526806,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24","_session_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24"}
{"text":"Akar\u00e1 was able to develop from the remnants of a cold front that had brought heavy rain to parts of South America before pushing offshore. The low-pressure system rapidly deepened into a tropical storm as it moved over warmer waters and was also fed by a plume of tropical moisture that moved southwards down the Brazilian coast. The storm did not bring a threat to the mainland as its trajectory was moving south-west over the Atlantic Ocean, but the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology was forecasting marine impacts with offshore waves of up to 4.9 metres (16ft) and winds of up to 50mph. By Tuesday, the Brazilian navy reported that the storm had weakened into a tropical depression as it continued to move away from mainland Brazil. The system weakened further on Wednesday as it travelled over cooler waters well offshore from the mainland.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/23/weather-tracker-china-contrasts-cold-heat-break-records_1","publication_date":"2024-02-23T09:47:05Z"},"_input_hash":-317381711,"_task_hash":-1290238047,"tokens":[{"text":"Akar\u00e1","start":0,"end":5,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"was","start":6,"end":9,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"able","start":10,"end":14,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":15,"end":17,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"develop","start":18,"end":25,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"from","start":26,"end":30,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":31,"end":34,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"remnants","start":35,"end":43,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":44,"end":46,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":47,"end":48,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"cold","start":49,"end":53,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"front","start":54,"end":59,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":60,"end":64,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"had","start":65,"end":68,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"brought","start":69,"end":76,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"heavy","start":77,"end":82,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"rain","start":83,"end":87,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":88,"end":90,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"parts","start":91,"end":96,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":97,"end":99,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"South","start":100,"end":105,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"America","start":106,"end":113,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"before","start":114,"end":120,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"pushing","start":121,"end":128,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"offshore","start":129,"end":137,"id":24,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":137,"end":138,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"The","start":139,"end":142,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"low","start":143,"end":146,"id":27,"ws":false},{"text":"-","start":146,"end":147,"id":28,"ws":false},{"text":"pressure","start":147,"end":155,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"system","start":156,"end":162,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"rapidly","start":163,"end":170,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"deepened","start":171,"end":179,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"into","start":180,"end":184,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":185,"end":186,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"tropical","start":187,"end":195,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"storm","start":196,"end":201,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":202,"end":204,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":205,"end":207,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"moved","start":208,"end":213,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"over","start":214,"end":218,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"warmer","start":219,"end":225,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"waters","start":226,"end":232,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":233,"end":236,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"was","start":237,"end":240,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"also","start":241,"end":245,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"fed","start":246,"end":249,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":250,"end":252,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":253,"end":254,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"plume","start":255,"end":260,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":261,"end":263,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"tropical","start":264,"end":272,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"moisture","start":273,"end":281,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":282,"end":286,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"moved","start":287,"end":292,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"southwards","start":293,"end":303,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"down","start":304,"end":308,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":309,"end":312,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"Brazilian","start":313,"end":322,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"coast","start":323,"end":328,"id":59,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":328,"end":329,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"The","start":330,"end":333,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"storm","start":334,"end":339,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"did","start":340,"end":343,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"not","start":344,"end":347,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"bring","start":348,"end":353,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":354,"end":355,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"threat","start":356,"end":362,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":363,"end":365,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":366,"end":369,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"mainland","start":370,"end":378,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":379,"end":381,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"its","start":382,"end":385,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"trajectory","start":386,"end":396,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"was","start":397,"end":400,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"moving","start":401,"end":407,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"south","start":408,"end":413,"id":76,"ws":false},{"text":"-","start":413,"end":414,"id":77,"ws":false},{"text":"west","start":414,"end":418,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"over","start":419,"end":423,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":424,"end":427,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"Atlantic","start":428,"end":436,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"Ocean","start":437,"end":442,"id":82,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":442,"end":443,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"but","start":444,"end":447,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":448,"end":451,"id":

Nancy Utesch, 59, a farmer in Kewaunee county, Wisconsin, has seen this first-hand. Many farms use manure as fertilizer on nearby crop fields, but overapplication can lead to pollution. Last April, she woke to the sounds of tractors spreading manure on a 30-acre property next to her farm. The parcel of land is home to two wetlands, which Utesch was worried would be contaminated if the spreading continued.

{"text":"That News Corp is anti-climate action is hardly a blinding insight, but it\u2019s worth raising because it continues to skew the debate. The people it elevates, particularly from fossil fuel lobby groups, get picked up and echoed elsewhere. And the government internalises the framing even while the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, oversees plans for an ambitious clean energy expansion. For those who watched the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai in December, the most notable climate discussion in Australia so far this year is one that isn\u2019t being had. It\u2019s now two months since nearly 200 countries backed a call for the world to transition away from fossil fuels. It might sound a statement of the obvious, but it hadn\u2019t happened before. The Dubai text said the transition should happen in line with what scientists say is necessary, including accelerating action \u201cin this critical decade\u201d. It doesn\u2019t bind anyone to anything, but the deal sends another important message to major institutional investors managing trillions of dollars in assets about where they should be directing their money if they want to remain profitable in the decades ahead. Given Australia is the world\u2019s third biggest fossil fuel exporter, logic suggests it might have triggered a serious discussion from the prime minister down of what this will mean for the country.

The people it elevates, particularly from fossil fuel lobby groups, get picked up and echoed elsewhere. And the government internalises the framing even while the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, oversees plans for an ambitious clean energy expansion. For those who watched the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai in December, the most notable climate discussion in Australia so far this year is one that isn\u2019t being had. It\u2019s now two months since nearly 200 countries backed a call for the world to transition away from fossil fuels. It might sound a statement of the obvious, but it hadn\u2019t happened before. The Dubai text said the transition should happen in line with what scientists say is necessary, including accelerating action \u201cin this critical decade\u201d.

{"text":"The EU aims to slash its net greenhouse gas pollution by 90% by 2040 as part of its push to become the world\u2019s first climate-neutral continent, the European Commission has announced before elections in June. Under a landmark proposal laid out by its executive body on Tuesday, the bloc will have to pump 90% less planet-heating gas into the air by 2040 than it did in 1990, a figure which includes the carbon it removes from the atmosphere. The target is at the bottom end of the 90-95% net cuts that the EU\u2019s scientific watchdog recommended in June, and meeting it would require a much faster shift to a clean economy. In the three decades between 1990 and 2021, the EU\u2019s 27 member states cut their emissions by just 30%, according to the European Environment Agency, leaving them half as long to do twice the work. Wopke Hoekstra, the EU climate commissioner, said the target sent a message to the world that Europe \u201ccontinues to lead the way\u201d on climate action. \u201cTackling the climate crisis is a marathon, not a sprint. We need to make sure everyone crosses the finish line and nobody is left behind,\u201d he said. The target, which is a recommendation for the next commission after European elections in June, is part of a bid to stop extreme weather from growing more violent. But some of the individual targets were scrapped at the last minute because of protests from farmers that have seen politicians in the EU and its member states row back on plans to make farms pollute less. Pieter de Pous, a nature policy expert at the climate thinktank E3G, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a more fitting use of the metaphor \u2018cutting off the branch you sit on\u2019 than witnessing

Under a landmark proposal laid out by its executive body on Tuesday, the bloc will have to pump 90% less planet-heating gas into the air by 2040 than it did in 1990, a figure which includes the carbon it removes from the atmosphere. The target is at the bottom end of the 90-95% net cuts that the EU\u2019s scientific watchdog recommended in June, and meeting it would require a much faster shift to a clean economy. In the three decades between 1990 and 2021, the EU\u2019s 27 member states cut their emissions by just 30%, according to the European Environment Agency, leaving them half as long to do twice the work. Wopke Hoekstra, the EU climate commissioner, said the target sent a message to the world that Europe \u201ccontinues to lead the way\u201d on climate action. \u201cTackling the climate crisis is a marathon, not a sprint. We need to make sure everyone crosses the finish line and nobody is left behind,\u201d he said. The target, which is a recommendation for the next commission after European elections in June, is part of a bid to stop extreme weather from growing more violent. But some of the individual targets were scrapped at the last minute because of protests from farmers that have seen politicians in the EU and its member states row back on plans to make farms pollute less. Pieter de Pous, a nature policy expert at the climate thinktank E3G, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a more fitting use of the metaphor \u2018cutting off the branch you sit on\u2019 than witnessing farmers unite in efforts to undermine the very climate policies designed to protect them from the devastating impacts of climate change.\u201d\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: become the world\u2019s first climate-neutral continent, shift to a clean economy, tackling the climate crisis\npolicy: Kigali Amendment on HFCs\ntechnology: clean economy"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710526949,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24","_session_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24"}
{"text":"Other approaches to cultivated meat require greater use of expensive growth factor chemicals and scaffolds for cells to grow on, Nir said. The technique is particularly suited to fish and seafood, whose meat is fairly uniform unlike, for example, marbled beef, he said. Like other cultivated meat, the product is not produced using antibiotics or hormones. Forsea Foods is the only company known to be producing cultivated meat using this technology. The company has raised $5.2m (\u00a34.1m) in investment, with more expected to be announced soon. Seren Kell, at thinktank Good Food Institute Europe, said: \u201cThe pioneering use of organoids could provide companies with the ability to tap into animal cells\u2019 inherent self-organising properties, effectively outsourcing the difficult task of developing cultivated meat and seafood onto nature itself.\u201d \u201cCultivated seafood pioneers are developing healthy and sustainable alternatives to an ever-growing range of local delicacies, giving people the food they love without contributing to problems such as overfishing and the destruction of precious marine habitats,\u201d she said. The GFI provided research funding to Forsea from 2021-23. In the US, Wildtype is growing salmon and BlueNalu tuna, Steakholder Foods in Israel has produced cultivated grouper fish, while Shiok Meats in Singapore is targeting shrimp, lobster and crab, and Cell4Food in the Azores is working on cultivated octopus. Earlier this week, Aleph Farms in Israel became the first company in the world to get regulatory health approval for cultivated

The technique is particularly suited to fish and seafood, whose meat is fairly uniform unlike, for example, marbled beef, he said. Like other cultivated meat, the product is not produced using antibiotics or hormones. Forsea Foods is the only company known to be producing cultivated meat using this technology. The company has raised $5.2m (\u00a34.1m) in investment, with more expected to be announced soon. Seren Kell, at thinktank Good Food Institute Europe, said: \u201cThe pioneering use of organoids could provide companies with the ability to tap into animal cells\u2019 inherent self-organising properties, effectively outsourcing the difficult task of developing cultivated meat and seafood onto nature itself.\u201d \u201cCultivated seafood pioneers are developing healthy and sustainable alternatives to an ever-growing range of local delicacies, giving people the food they love without contributing to problems such as overfishing and the destruction of precious marine habitats,\u201d she said.

In the US, Wildtype is growing salmon and BlueNalu tuna, Steakholder Foods in Israel has produced cultivated grouper fish, while Shiok Meats in Singapore is targeting shrimp, lobster and crab, and Cell4Food in the Azores is working on cultivated octopus.

{"text":"A Texas county has launched a first-of-its-kind criminal investigation into the waste management giant Synagro over PFAS-contaminated sewage sludge it is selling to Texas farmers as a cheap alternative to fertilizer. Two small Texas ranches at the center of that case have also filed a federal lawsuit against Synagro, alleging the company knew its sludge was contaminated but still sold it. Sludge spread on a nearby field sickened the farmers, killed livestock, polluted drinking water, contaminated beef later sold to the public and left their properties worthless, the complaint alleges. The PFAS levels independent testing found on the farm were \u201cshockingly high\u201d, said Kyla Bennett, policy director for the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (Peer) non-profit, which is assisting in the analyses. The farms\u2019 drinking water was found to be contaminated at levels over 13,000 times higher than the federal health advisory for PFOS, one kind of PFAS compound, a Guardian calculation indicates, and affected meat was as much as 250,000 times above safe levels, the lawsuit alleges.

The volunteers are all over 50 and have a family history of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s disease. McFiggans and his team create standardised mixtures of cooking fumes, cleaning products, diesel exhaust and woodstove smoke to simulate concentrations found in smogs found in many large cities.

{"text":"Once again, the Young Country Diary series is open for submissions! Every three months, as the UK enters a new season, we ask you to send us a piece written by a child aged 8-14. The article needs to be about a recent encounter they\u2019ve had with nature \u2013 whether it\u2019s a woodland walk, some nesting birds or a thriving rockpool. Crucially, it doesn\u2019t matter if the child is a nature expert or has never picked up a pair of binoculars. We are especially keen to reach teachers who might like to get their class outside and noticing nature. Please note the deadline for entry is noon on Monday 1 April. Six winning entries will be chosen, and published in the Guardian newspaper and online \u2013 two on 23 March, two on 27 April and two on 25 May. On 1 June we\u2019ll launch a fresh callout looking for summer pieces. Note that if you send your piece in early enough, you stand a chance of being published on 23 March.

We\u2019re working with the current administration of the US to at least develop the agenda to work together, to achieve the targets together.\u201d Azerbaijan has been an oil producer since the 1840s, and is one of the world\u2019s top fossil fuel suppliers. Oil and gas account for 92% of the country\u2019s exports, according to US data, and about two-thirds of the state budget, and the country is planning to increase its gas output by a third in the next decade. Babayev said the government was moving to decarbonise the economy, boosting renewable energy and seeking a transition away from fossil fuels. Oil production was expected to reduce, he said, but gas production would need to increase to meet demands from the EU, which since the invasion of Ukraine had sought to find gas supplies to replace those it used to get from Russia. \u201cWe have to deliver [gas] to the European market, because of a big request from the EU. We have already adopted a programme to deliver more gas.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: decarbonise the economy, boosting renewable energy, seeking a transition away from fossil fuels\npolicy: \ntechnology: renewable energy\nmethod: decarbonise the economy, transition away from fossil fuels, increase gas output"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710527060,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24","_session_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24"}
{"text":"To understand the overall size of these indoor impacts, two researchers from the University of Lisbon have been estimating how much heating a home with a wood stove or fireplace shortens the lives of the occupants. Dr Nuno Martins explained what prompted their research: \u201cThe initial idea came from hearing a podcast that had Guardian columnist George Monbiot as a guest. We looked more into it and found that there wasn\u2019t much data on how much particle pollution was released by wood-burning equipment into homes.\u201d Martins and his team started by measuring air pollution from stoves and fireplaces in a small number of homes. This data was used in computer simulations of three homes in north-west Europe: in Birmingham, Groningen and Copenhagen, and combined with data from the health effects of outdoor air pollution. Heating a living-room open fireplace for four hours each winter\u2019s evening was estimated to shorten the occupant\u2019s life expectancy by between one and 1.6 years. Using a stove could reduce overall life expectancy by up to six months. This comes with important caveats. Indoor and outdoor air pollution have different sources; chemical composition and exposure. Less is known about how to calculate the impact of air pollution that we breathe in our homes, but the research could help scientists understand the approximate extent of the health impact on people with stoves and fireplaces, as well as possible solutions.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/26/domestic-wood-burners-having-a-deadly-impact-in-outside-areas_2","publication_date":"2024-01-26T06:00:24Z"},"_input_hash":-1765629447,"_task_hash":1178004981,"tokens":[{"text":"To","start":0,"end":2,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"understand","start":3,"end":13,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":14,"end":17,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"overall","start":18,"end":25,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"size","start":26,"end":30,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":31,"end":33,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"these","start":34,"end":39,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"indoor","start":40,"end":46,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"impacts","start":47,"end":54,"id":8,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":54,"end":55,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"two","start":56,"end":59,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"researchers","start":60,"end":71,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"from","start":72,"end":76,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":77,"end":80,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"University","start":81,"end":91,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":92,"end":94,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"Lisbon","start":95,"end":101,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"have","start":102,"end":106,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"been","start":107,"end":111,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"estimating","start":112,"end":122,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"how","start":123,"end":126,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"much","start":127,"end":131,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"heating","start":132,"end":139,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":140,"end":141,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"home","start":142,"end":146,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":147,"end":151,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":152,"end":153,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"wood","start":154,"end":158,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"stove","start":159,"end":164,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"or","start":165,"end":167,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"fireplace","start":168,"end":177,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"shortens","start":178,"end":186,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":187,"end":190,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"lives","start":191,"end":196,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":197,"end":199,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":200,"end":203,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"occupants","start":204,"end":213,"id":36,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":213,"end":214,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"Dr","start":215,"end":217,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"Nuno","start":218,"end":222,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"Martins","start":223,"end":230,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"explained","start":231,"end":240,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"what","start":241,"end":245,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"prompted","start":246,"end":254,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"their","start":255,"end":260,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"research","start":261,"end":269,"id":45,"ws":false},{"text":":","start":269,"end":270,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"\u201c","start":271,"end":272,"id":47,"ws":false},{"text":"The","start":272,"end":275,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"initial","start":276,"end":283,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"idea","start":284,"end":288,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"came","start":289,"end":293,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"from","start":294,"end":298,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"hearing","start":299,"end":306,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":307,"end":308,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"podcast","start":309,"end":316,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":317,"end":321,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"had","start":322,"end":325,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"Guardian","start":326,"end":334,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"columnist","start":335,"end":344,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"George","start":345,"end":351,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"Monbiot","start":352,"end":359,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":360,"end":362,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":363,"end":364,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"guest","start":365,"end":370,"id":64,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":370,"end":371,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"We","start":372,"end":374,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"looked","start":375,"end":381,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"more","start":382,"end":386,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"into","start":387,"end":391,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":392,"end":394,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":395,"end":398,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"found","start":399,"end":404,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":405,"end":409,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"there","start":410,"end":415,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"was","start":416,"end":419,"id":75,"ws":false},{"text":"n\u2019t","start":419,"end":422,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"much","start":423,"end":427,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"data","start":428,"end":432,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":433,"end":435,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"how","start":436,"end":439,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"much","start":440,"end":444,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"particle","start":445,"end":453,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"pollution","start":454,"end":463,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"was","start":464,"end":467,"id":84,"ws":true},{"t

We looked more into it and found that there wasn\u2019t much data on how much particle pollution was released by wood-burning equipment into homes.\u201d Martins and his team started by measuring air pollution from stoves and fireplaces in a small number of homes. This data was used in computer simulations of three homes in north-west Europe: in Birmingham, Groningen and Copenhagen, and combined with data from the health effects of outdoor air pollution. Heating a living-room open fireplace for four hours each winter\u2019s evening was estimated to shorten the occupant\u2019s life expectancy by between one and 1.6 years. Using a stove could reduce overall life expectancy by up to six months. This comes with important caveats. Indoor and outdoor air pollution have different sources; chemical composition and exposure. Less is known about how to calculate the impact of air pollution that we breathe in our homes, but the research could help scientists understand the approximate extent of the health impact on people with stoves and fireplaces, as well as possible solutions.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: measuring air pollution, computer simulations\npolicy: \ntechnology: wood stove, fireplace, air pollution, stoves, fireplaces"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710527082,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24","_session_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24"}

He expressed fears swimmers who could be made ill by the sewage, with no compensation from water companies after Conservatives blocked a proposed new law in parliament earlier this month.

The freezing cold water should be the only thing swimmers worry about, not sewage floating by them,\u201d Farron said. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting that our coastlines and lakes have been polluted by this foul habit.

{"text":"Last month, these upright winter thrushes \u2013 fieldfares and redwings \u2013 fed systematically across plough and playing fields like a well-spaced army. Pulling a worm, hopping some paces, picking a beetle, hopping again, all travelling in the same direction until they reached the end of the field, then travelling back in the same manner. But now, it\u2019s time to go. The burbling stream of aerial chatter meandering through the twiggy heights is the early spring equivalent of swallows gathering on autumn wires. Yet these harbingers of the winter-spring are congregating to head north for their summer. The mist thickens to rain. As it falls and hisses on the boggy field, the birdsong is absorbed back into it. As I tug the winter-swollen five\u2011bar gate shut, I spot several fallow deer slots pushed into the mud as they made a great leap over this more obvious barrier than the flimsy fence. \u2022 Country

{"text":"An electric vehicle owner has used her car\u2019s emergency power system to run her 11-year-old son\u2019s life-saving dialysis machine and another has ridden to the rescue of his neighbours after devastating storms cut power in south-east Queensland. When the power went down after storms and flash flooding on Christmas Day, many residents immediately felt the consequences: electric gates did not work, septic tanks began to fill, air conditioners could not run and fridges began to warm as a heatwave followed. But some electric vehicle drivers whose cars are equipped with \u201cvehicle to load\u201d systems \u2013 a back-up power system that allows the car to act as an emergency generator or supply for devices such as lights, laptops, TVs and refrigerators \u2013 stepped in to help out and, in some cases, save lives. One woman on the Gold Coast, Kristy Holmes, 42, used her BYD electric car to power her 11-year-old son\u2019s dialysis machine after their power shut off on Christmas Day. At first, Holmes and her husband used the car to plug in their fridges and those of their neighbours in the adjoining units but when the power did not come back on quickly, she started to wonder whether the BYD Atto 3 the couple bought in February could also handle the life-saving dialysis machine. \u201cWe ran it off the car,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cWe only needed to use it for the one night.

{"text":"There was no evidence that wild pig populations would fully recover in Borneo or other south-east Asian islands such as Java and Sumatra in Indonesia, Timor-Leste and the Philippines, the scientists said. In Borneo, the loss of bearded pigs is already having an enormous impact on cultures and communities that depend on them for food. Local studies suggest bearded pigs once accounted for 81% of hunted wildlife by weight in some villages. Now, that number is closer to zero. \u201cIt\u2019s a food security issue and a poverty issue. People are just fully dependent on access to wild and feral pigs for their protein needs,\u201d said Meijaard. The disappearance of this key protein source puts pressure on other species: in the absence of pigs, millions of local people were likely to shift their focus to hunting endangered species such as pig-tailed macaques, the scientists warned. The loss of wild pigs can also affect the ecosystem as a whole. Bearded pigs disperse the seeds of trees as they eat fruits and migrate large distances, defecating them out throughout the forest. They also turn over soil with their snouts, which cleans undergrowth and gives tree roots access to more soil nutrients.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/19/african-swine-fever-asian-wild-pigs-borneo-aoe_1","publication_date":"2024-01-19T06:00:21Z"},"_input_hash":-318617319,"_task_hash":-801908639,"tokens":[{"text":"There","start":0,"end":5,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"was","start":6,"end":9,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"no","start":10,"end":12,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"evidence","start":13,"end":21,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":22,"end":26,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"wild","start":27,"end":31,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"pig","start":32,"end":35,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"populations","start":36,"end":47,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"would","start":48,"end":53,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"fully","start":54,"end":59,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"recover","start":60,"end":67,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":68,"end":70,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"Borneo","start":71,"end":77,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"or","start":78,"end":80,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"other","start":81,"end":86,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"south","start":87,"end":92,"id":15,"ws":false},{"text":"-","start":92,"end":93,"id":16,"ws":false},{"text":"east","start":93,"end":97,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"Asian","start":98,"end":103,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"islands","start":104,"end":111,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"such","start":112,"end":116,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":117,"end":119,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"Java","start":120,"end":124,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":125,"end":128,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"Sumatra","start":129,"end":136,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":137,"end":139,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"Indonesia","start":140,"end":149,"id":26,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":149,"end":150,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"Timor","start":151,"end":156,"id":28,"ws":false},{"text":"-","start":156,"end":157,"id":29,"ws":false},{"text":"Leste","start":157,"end":162,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":163,"end":166,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":167,"end":170,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"Philippines","start":171,"end":182,"id":33,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":182,"end":183,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":184,"end":187,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"scientists","start":188,"end":198,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"said","start":199,"end":203,"id":37,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":203,"end":204,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"In","start":205,"end":207,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"Borneo","start":208,"end":214,"id":40,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":214,"end":215,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":216,"end":219,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"loss","start":220,"end":224,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":225,"end":227,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"bearded","start":228,"end":235,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"pigs","start":236,"end":240,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":241,"end":243,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"already","start":244,"end":251,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"having","start":252,"end":258,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"an","start":259,"end":261,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"enormous","start":262,"end":270,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"impact","start":271,"end":277,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":278,"end":280,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"cultures","start":281,"end":289,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":290,"end":293,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"communities","start":294,"end":305,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":306,"end":310,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"depend","start":311,"end":317,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":318,"end":320,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"them","start":321,"end":325,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":326,"end":329,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"food","start":330,"end":334,"id":62,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":334,"end":335,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"Local","start":336,"end":341,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"studies","start":342,"end":349,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"suggest","start":350,"end":357,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"bearded","start":358,"end":365,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"pigs","start":366,"end":370,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"once","start":371,"end":375,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"accounted","start":376,"end":385,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":386,"end":389,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"81","start":390,"end":392,"id":72,"ws":false},{"text":"%","start":392,"end":393,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":394,"end":396,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"hunted","start":397,"end":403,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"wildlife","start":404,"end":412,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":413,"end":415,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"weight","start":416,"end":422,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":423,"end":425,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"some","start":426,"end":430,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"villages","start":431,"end":439,"id":81,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":439,"end":440,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"Now","start":441,"end":444,"id":83,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":444,"end":445,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":446,"end":450,"id":85

Local studies suggest bearded pigs once accounted for 81% of hunted wildlife by weight in some villages. Now, that number is closer to zero. \u201cIt\u2019s a food security issue and a poverty issue. People are just fully dependent on access to wild and feral pigs for their protein needs,\u201d said Meijaard. The disappearance of this key protein source puts pressure on other species: in the absence of pigs, millions of local people were likely to shift their focus to hunting endangered species such as pig-tailed macaques, the scientists warned. The loss of wild pigs can also affect the ecosystem as a whole. Bearded pigs disperse the seeds of trees as they eat fruits and migrate large distances, defecating them out throughout the forest. They also turn over soil with their snouts, which cleans undergrowth and gives tree roots access to more soil nutrients.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: wild pig populations, bearded pigs, pig-tailed macaques, soil science, microorganisms, tree seeds, defecating, undergrowth, soil nutrients"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710527380,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24","_session_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24"}

It is now empty, other than some bones, feathers and a few old tags from unlucky racer pigeons. \u201cThis is where it all started,\u201d says Smith. In 2021, it had belonged to a female falcon, who had tried and failed to breed here for a couple of years. In April that year, one month after the initial intelligence had come through, Smith climbed up the cliff with PC Gavin Ross. The falcon had been sitting on four eggs, but now two were missing. When the men turned around to go down, they saw a footprint, still fresh in the stony soil \u2013 but not the way they had came up.

{"text":"Alok Sharma has said the government\u2019s oil and gas bill going through the Commons will not cut household energy costs or create jobs and instead will break the UK\u2019s promise to phase out fossil fuels. The government\u2019s offshore petroleum licensing bill passed its second reading on Monday night with 293 votes to 211 against. No Conservative MPs voted against it, and Sharma \u2013 the former business secretary who served as president of the Cop26 climate talks \u2013 abstained. The legislation would place the North Sea Transition Authority under a duty to run annual applications for new offshore oil and gas licences. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of hundreds of scientists, has said no new oil and gas licences should be granted if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Going beyond this would cause climate catastrophe, ruining the lives of millions. UK ministers promised to phase out oil and gas at last year\u2019s Cop28 conference in Dubai. Referring to minister Graham Stuart who represented the UK at the conference, Sharma said: \u201cMy right honourable friend tweeted himself at Cop28 that there must be an unabated phaseout of fossil fuels to meet our climate goals.

The government\u2019s offshore petroleum licensing bill passed its second reading on Monday night with 293 votes to 211 against. No Conservative MPs voted against it, and Sharma \u2013 the former business secretary who served as president of the Cop26 climate talks \u2013 abstained. The legislation would place the North Sea Transition Authority under a duty to run annual applications for new offshore oil and gas licences. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of hundreds of scientists, has said no new oil and gas licences should be granted if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Going beyond this would cause climate catastrophe, ruining the lives of millions. UK ministers promised to phase out oil and gas at last year\u2019s Cop28 conference in Dubai. Referring to minister Graham Stuart who represented the UK at the conference, Sharma said: \u201cMy right honourable friend tweeted himself at Cop28 that there must be an unabated phaseout of fossil fuels to meet our climate goals. But today we have a bill before this house, the sole purpose of which is to double down on granting more oil and gas production licences. I do not believe, and it pains me to say this, that this bill will advance that commitment to transition away from fossil fuels.\u201d\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: phase out fossil fuels, transition away from fossil fuels\npolicy: oil and gas bill, offshore petroleum licensing bill, North Sea Transition Authority\ntechnology: offshore oil and gas licences, global heating, climate catastrophe, fossil fuels"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710527443,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24","_session_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24"}
{"text":"Biodiversity-conscious eaters could consider substituting potatoes for rice, cutting down on beef and lamb and asking where their beans, lentils and chickpeas are grown to reduce their impact on nature, a new study has found. Scientists analysed 151 popular recipes around the world for their biodiversity impact. They found meat dishes were the worst offenders: recipes including chilli con carne, salsa verde pork and a Spanish lamb dish called lechazo, all had high biodiversity damage scores compared with vegan and vegetarian ones. The massive environmental impact of eating meat has been well established, and the study reinforced this, with meat dishes scoring more than vegetarian or vegan dishes across almost all locally and globally produced scenarios. Brazilian-raised beef topped the charts. But the study, published on Wednesday in Plos One journal, also had surprising findings about the biodiversity footprint of some grains and legumes. Recipes that use rice and legumes \u2013 like the chickpea-based dish chana masala and the kidney bean rajma curry \u2013 can cause problems too, depending on where ingredients are grown. \u201cThe origin of the beans or lentils you are using matters quite a bit,\u201d said Roman Carrasco, one of the paper\u2019s authors and an associate professor of biological sciences at the National University of Singapore (NUS). The study\u2019s lead author, Elissa Cheng, a life science graduate at the NUS department of biological sciences, said: \u201cThe study highlights particular problems for dishes using ingredients from tropical areas rich in biodiversity, including Brazil and Mexico.\u201d India \u201cpresents a perfect storm\u201d, Carrasco said, because it has high levels of biodiversity, including many endemic species that can only live in very specific areas, combined with \u201chigh levels of those critical areas being heavily encroached by crops like rice, chickpeas, beans and

Scientists analysed 151 popular recipes around the world for their biodiversity impact. They found meat dishes were the worst offenders: recipes including chilli con carne, salsa verde pork and a Spanish lamb dish called lechazo, all had high biodiversity damage scores compared with vegan and vegetarian ones. The massive environmental impact of eating meat has been well established, and the study reinforced this, with meat dishes scoring more than vegetarian or vegan dishes across almost all locally and globally produced scenarios. Brazilian-raised beef topped the charts. But the study, published on Wednesday in Plos One journal, also had surprising findings about the biodiversity footprint of some grains and legumes. Recipes that use rice and legumes \u2013 like the chickpea-based dish chana masala and the kidney bean rajma curry \u2013 can cause problems too, depending on where ingredients are grown. \u201cThe origin of the beans or lentils you are using matters quite a bit,\u201d said Roman Carrasco, one of the paper\u2019s authors and an associate professor of biological sciences at the National University of Singapore (NUS). The study\u2019s lead author, Elissa Cheng, a life science graduate at the NUS department of biological sciences, said: \u201cThe study highlights particular problems for dishes using ingredients from tropical areas rich in biodiversity, including Brazil and Mexico.\u201d India \u201cpresents a perfect storm\u201d, Carrasco said, because it has high levels of biodiversity, including many endemic species that can only live in very specific areas, combined with \u201chigh levels of those critical areas being heavily encroached by crops like rice, chickpeas, beans and lentils\u201d.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: substituting potatoes for rice, cutting down on beef and lamb, asking where beans, lentils, and chickpeas are grown\npolicy: \ntechnology: rice, beans, lentils, chickpeas"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710527472,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24","_session_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24"}
{"text":"\u201cPerhaps the raw materials are less, but are we using more water, are we using more energy, to keep it clean?\u201d Paper towels: two rolls a week is like burning 11 gallons of gasoline Let\u2019s start with the competition. Paper towels have a hefty environmental impact because they\u2019re made of, well, paper. Most of their impacts occur during the manufacturing phase \u2013 as opposed to when they\u2019re in use. According to a 2016 life cycle assessment of Bounty brand paper towels, paper towels\u2019 most significant environmental impact is in the realm of fossil fuel depletion. That is, the amount of fossil fuels used to produce the paper pulp, and keep paper towel making facilities open. But paper towel production also requires agricultural land occupation (99% of which is for the growth of trees) and leads to particulate matter formation. One 2012 study from MIT found that two paper towels account for approximately 15 grams of CO2 emissions. Extrapolating from that, the recycling blog Earth911.com estimates that a family of four that uses two rolls of paper towels a week creates about 219lbs of CO2 emissions a year, \u201cor about the same as burning 11 gallons of gasoline\u201d. And those paper towels add up: in 2017, Americans spent $5.7bn on paper towels (about $17.50 a person) \u2013 almost half of the $12bn spent globally.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/12/what-is-swedish-dishcloth-reusable-paper-towel-better-environment_1","publication_date":"2024-03-12T12:00:29Z"},"_input_hash":1412455087,"_task_hash":1373936498,"tokens":[{"text":"\u201c","start":0,"end":1,"id":0,"ws":false},{"text":"Perhaps","start":1,"end":8,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":9,"end":12,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"raw","start":13,"end":16,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"materials","start":17,"end":26,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":27,"end":30,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"less","start":31,"end":35,"id":6,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":35,"end":36,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"but","start":37,"end":40,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":41,"end":44,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"we","start":45,"end":47,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"using","start":48,"end":53,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"more","start":54,"end":58,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"water","start":59,"end":64,"id":13,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":64,"end":65,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":66,"end":69,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"we","start":70,"end":72,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"using","start":73,"end":78,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"more","start":79,"end":83,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"energy","start":84,"end":90,"id":19,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":90,"end":91,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":92,"end":94,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"keep","start":95,"end":99,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":100,"end":102,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"clean","start":103,"end":108,"id":24,"ws":false},{"text":"?","start":108,"end":109,"id":25,"ws":false},{"text":"\u201d","start":109,"end":110,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"Paper","start":111,"end":116,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"towels","start":117,"end":123,"id":28,"ws":false},{"text":":","start":123,"end":124,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"two","start":125,"end":128,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"rolls","start":129,"end":134,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":135,"end":136,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"week","start":137,"end":141,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":142,"end":144,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"like","start":145,"end":149,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"burning","start":150,"end":157,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"11","start":158,"end":160,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"gallons","start":161,"end":168,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":169,"end":171,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"gasoline","start":172,"end":180,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"Let","start":181,"end":184,"id":41,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":184,"end":186,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"start","start":187,"end":192,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":193,"end":197,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":198,"end":201,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"competition","start":202,"end":213,"id":46,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":213,"end":214,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"Paper","start":215,"end":220,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"towels","start":221,"end":227,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"have","start":228,"end":232,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":233,"end":234,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"hefty","start":235,"end":240,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"environmental","start":241,"end":254,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"impact","start":255,"end":261,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"because","start":262,"end":269,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"they","start":270,"end":274,"id":56,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019re","start":274,"end":277,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"made","start":278,"end":282,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":283,"end":285,"id":59,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":285,"end":286,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"well","start":287,"end":291,"id":61,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":291,"end":292,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"paper","start":293,"end":298,"id":63,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":298,"end":299,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"Most","start":300,"end":304,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":305,"end":307,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"their","start":308,"end":313,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"impacts","start":314,"end":321,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"occur","start":322,"end":327,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"during","start":328,"end":334,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":335,"end":338,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"manufacturing","start":339,"end":352,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"phase","start":353,"end":358,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"\u2013","start":359,"end":360,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":361,"end":363,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"opposed","start":364,"end":371,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":372,"end":374,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"when","start":375,"end":379,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"they","start":380,"end":384,"id":79,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019re","start":384,"end":387,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":388,"end":390,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"use","start":391,"end":394,"id":82,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":394,"end":395,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"According","start":396,"end":405,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":406,"end":408,"id":

Paper towels have a hefty environmental impact because they\u2019re made of, well, paper. Most of their impacts occur during the manufacturing phase \u2013 as opposed to when they\u2019re in use. According to a 2016 life cycle assessment of Bounty brand paper towels, paper towels\u2019 most significant environmental impact is in the realm of fossil fuel depletion. That is, the amount of fossil fuels used to produce the paper pulp, and keep paper towel making facilities open. But paper towel production also requires agricultural land occupation (99% of which is for the growth of trees) and leads to particulate matter formation. One 2012 study from MIT found that two paper towels account for approximately 15 grams of CO2 emissions. Extrapolating from that, the recycling blog Earth911.com estimates that a family of four that uses two rolls of paper towels a week creates about 219lbs of CO2 emissions a year, \u201cor about the same as burning 11 gallons of gasoline\u201d.

Ministers published a roadmap on Friday that recommits the government to building a fleet of nuclear reactors capable of producing 24GW by 2050 \u2013 enough to meet a quarter of the national electricity demand. Approval will be given for one or two new reactors every five years from 2030 to 2044, and backing given to another large-scale reactor in addition to Hinkley Point C and the planned Sizewell C , even as the projects face uncertainty over their costs and timescale. The roadmap echoes plans put forward by the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, in 2022 to \u201cbuild a new [reactor] every year\u201d to wean Britain off fossil fuel. Since then the developer of Hinkley Point C, the French utility EDF, has said the cost of Britain\u2019s first new nuclear plant in a generation had spiralled to \u00a333bn, a 30% increase from 2015 when it forecast the cost at between \u00a325bn to 26bn. There are also concerns that Hinkley\u2019s start date may be delayed from the summer of 2027 to the early 2030s. Sunak said the government\u2019s latest support for the nuclear industry was \u201cthe next step in our commitment to nuclear power, which puts us on course to achieve net zero by 2050 in a measured and sustainable way\u201d. \u201cNuclear is the perfect antidote to the energy challenges facing Britain \u2013 it\u2019s green, cheaper in the long term and will ensure the UK\u2019s energy security for the long term,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will ensure our future energy security and create the jobs and skills we need to level up the country and grow our economy.\u201d EDF said in January it would delay the shutdown of four of its UK nuclear reactors for at least two years to help plug the looming gap in the UK\u2019s nuclear supplies towards the end of the decade.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/11/uk-government-sets-out-plans-for-biggest-nuclear-power-expansion-in-70-years_0","publication_date":"2024-01-11T00:01:26Z"},"_input_hash":860912142,"_task_hash":127975418,"tokens":[{"text":"The","start":0,"end":3,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"government","start":4,"end":14,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"has","start":15,"end":18,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"set","start":19,"end":22,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"out","start":23,"end":26,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"plans","start":27,"end":32,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":33,"end":36,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"what","start":37,"end":41,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":42,"end":44,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"claims","start":45,"end":51,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"will","start":52,"end":56,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":57,"end":59,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"Britain","start":60,"end":67,"id":12,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":67,"end":69,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"biggest","start":70,"end":77,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"nuclear","start":78,"end":85,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"power","start":86,"end":91,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"expansion","start":92,"end":101,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":102,"end":104,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"70","start":105,"end":107,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"years","start":108,"end":113,"id":20,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":113,"end":114,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"despite","start":115,"end":122,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"concerns","start":123,"end":131,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"about","start":132,"end":137,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"faltering","start":138,"end":147,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"nuclear","start":148,"end":155,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"output","start":156,"end":162,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":163,"end":166,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"project","start":167,"end":174,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"delays","start":175,"end":181,"id":30,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":181,"end":182,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"Ministers","start":183,"end":192,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"published","start":193,"end":202,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":203,"end":204,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"roadmap","start":205,"end":212,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":213,"end":215,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"Friday","start":216,"end":222,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":223,"end":227,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"recommits","start":228,"end":237,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":238,"end":241,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"government","start":242,"end":252,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":253,"end":255,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"building","start":256,"end":264,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":265,"end":266,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"fleet","start":267,"end":272,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":273,"end":275,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"nuclear","start":276,"end":283,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"reactors","start":284,"end":292,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"capable","start":293,"end":300,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":301,"end":303,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"producing","start":304,"end":313,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"24GW","start":314,"end":318,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":319,"end":321,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"2050","start":322,"end":326,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"\u2013","start":327,"end":328,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"enough","start":329,"end":335,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":336,"end":338,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"meet","start":339,"end":343,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":344,"end":345,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"quarter","start":346,"end":353,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":354,"end":356,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":357,"end":360,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"national","start":361,"end":369,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"electricity","start":370,"end":381,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"demand","start":382,"end":388,"id":65,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":388,"end":389,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"Approval","start":390,"end":398,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"will","start":399,"end":403,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":404,"end":406,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"given","start":407,"end":412,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":413,"end":416,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"one","start":417,"end":420,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"or","start":421,"end":423,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"two","start":424,"end":427,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"new","start":428,"end":431,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"reactors","start":432,"end":440,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"every","start":441,"end":446,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"five","start":447,"end":451,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"years","start":452,"end":457,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"from","start":458,"end":462,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"2030","start":463,"end":467,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":468,"end":470,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"2044","start":471,"end":475,"id":83,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":475,"end":476,"id":84,

Ministers published a roadmap on Friday that recommits the government to building a fleet of nuclear reactors capable of producing 24GW by 2050 \u2013 enough to meet a quarter of the national electricity demand. Approval will be given for one or two new reactors every five years from 2030 to 2044, and backing given to another large-scale reactor in addition to Hinkley Point C and the planned Sizewell C , even as the projects face uncertainty over their costs and timescale. The roadmap echoes plans put forward by the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, in 2022 to \u201cbuild a new [reactor] every year\u201d to wean Britain off fossil fuel. Since then the developer of Hinkley Point C, the French utility EDF, has said the cost of Britain\u2019s first new nuclear plant in a generation had spiralled to \u00a333bn, a 30% increase from 2015 when it forecast the cost at between \u00a325bn to 26bn. There are also concerns that Hinkley\u2019s start date may be delayed from the summer of 2027 to the early 2030s. Sunak said the government\u2019s latest support for the nuclear industry was \u201cthe next step in our commitment to nuclear power, which puts us on course to achieve net zero by 2050 in a measured and sustainable way\u201d. \u201cNuclear is the perfect antidote to the energy challenges facing Britain \u2013 it\u2019s green, cheaper in the long term and will ensure the UK\u2019s energy security for the long term,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will ensure our future energy security and create the jobs and skills we need to level up the country and grow our economy.\u201d EDF said in January it would delay the shutdown of four of its UK nuclear reactors for at least two years to help plug the looming gap in the UK\u2019s nuclear supplies towards the end of the decade.\n'''"],"response":["project: Hinkley Point C, Sizewell C\ninitiative: build a new [reactor] every year\npolicy: \ntechnology: nuclear reactors\nmethod: achieving net zero by 2050, delaying the shutdown of nuclear reactors"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710527563,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24","_session_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24"}
{"text":"The global extraction of raw materials is expected to increase by 60% by 2060, with calamitous consequences for the climate and the environment, according an unpublished UN analysis seen by the Guardian. Natural resource extraction has soared by almost 400% since 1970 due to industrialisation, urbanisation and population growth, according to a presentation of the five-yearly UN Global Resource Outlook made to EU ministers last week. The stripping of Earth\u2019s natural materials is already responsible for 60% of global heating impacts, including land use change, 40% of air pollution impact, and more than 90% of global water stress and land-related biodiversity loss, says the report, due to be released in February. Janez Poto\u010dnik, a former European commissioner and a co-chair of the UN panel that produced the analysis, said a gouging of raw materials on the scale predicted would almost certainly trigger more frequent and more severe storms, droughts and other climate disasters. \u201cHigher figures mean higher impacts,\u201d he said. \u201cIn essence, there are no more safe spaces on Earth. We are already out of our safe operating space and if these trends continue, things will get worse. Extreme weather events will simply become much more frequent and that will have ever more serious financial and human costs.\u201d The report prioritises equity and human wellbeing measurements over GDP growth alone and proposes action to reduce overall demand rather than simply increasing \u201cgreen\u201d production. Electric vehicles, for example, use almost 10 times more \u201ccritical raw materials\u201d than conventional cars, and reaching net zero transport emissions by 2050 would require increasing critical mineral extraction for them sixfold within 15

Natural resource extraction has soared by almost 400% since 1970 due to industrialisation, urbanisation and population growth, according to a presentation of the five-yearly UN Global Resource Outlook made to EU ministers last week. The stripping of Earth\u2019s natural materials is already responsible for 60% of global heating impacts, including land use change, 40% of air pollution impact, and more than 90% of global water stress and land-related biodiversity loss, says the report, due to be released in February. Janez Poto\u010dnik, a former European commissioner and a co-chair of the UN panel that produced the analysis, said a gouging of raw materials on the scale predicted would almost certainly trigger more frequent and more severe storms, droughts and other climate disasters. \u201cHigher figures mean higher impacts,\u201d he said. \u201cIn essence, there are no more safe spaces on Earth. We are already out of our safe operating space and if these trends continue, things will get worse. Extreme weather events will simply become much more frequent and that will have ever more serious financial and human costs.\u201d The report prioritises equity and human wellbeing measurements over GDP growth alone and proposes action to reduce overall demand rather than simply increasing \u201cgreen\u201d production. Electric vehicles, for example, use almost 10 times more \u201ccritical raw materials\u201d than conventional cars, and reaching net zero transport emissions by 2050 would require increasing critical mineral extraction for them sixfold within 15 years.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: reduce overall demand, reaching net zero transport emissions by 2050\npolicy: \ntechnology: electric vehicles, critical raw materials"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710527571,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24","_session_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24"}
{"text":"Legally, captive-bred peregrine falcons can be traded, but the birds cannot be taken from the wild. They are strictly protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. For racers, however, wild birds are more desirable: considered stronger, fiercer and faster. UK birds, particularly Scottish specimens, are prized in the Middle East. Between 2007 and 2022 there was a 4,500% increase in export permits for UK peregrines, according to Police Scotland, and it is not known how many were illegally caught. The police raid In May 2021, one month after the trip to the quarry, the police and the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals raided the home of a part-time gamekeeper, Timothy Hall, 48, and his 23-year-old son, Lewis, in Berwickshire. Police immediately heard the sound of chicks. They found seven in the house, each just a couple of days old.

{"text":"The KNMI report concludes that climate policy that focuses on reducing emissions can make a big difference to the future of Dutch Caribbean islands such as Bonaire. Research by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, commissioned by Greenpeace, shows sea-level rise is likely to permanently submerge parts of the island by 2050, a problem exacerbated by the loss of coral reefs as a natural buffer against the oceans warming and acidifying. The studies also concluded that the climate crisis would exacerbate health problems on the island and could ruin its cultural heritage and tourism industry. Bonaire is a popular diving destination, and the degradation of coral reefs could lead to the loss of the majority of dive sites, which it is estimated will reduce visitor numbers by more than 100,000. The group of islanders, most of whom still live on Bonaire and are Dutch citizens, want the Netherlands to tighten its climate goals, so it contributes its \u201cfair share\u201d to keep global heating below 1.5C above preindustrial levels, which would involve reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 \u2013 10 years earlier than its current target. They also want solid plans, developed with the islands\u2019 inhabitants, to protect Bonaire from the consequences of the climate emergeency, to ensure that islanders can continue to live there, and pass on their traditions and culture to their children. Not doing this, they argue, is a breach of their human rights, particularly their right to life, and respect for private and family life. Eefje de Kroon, the climate justice expert at Greenpeace Netherlands who is working on the case, noted that the Netherlands is known for its advanced water-management strategies on the mainland, but the government has done very little to study how the climate crisis will affect its Caribbean outposts and how they could be protected. The national adaptation strategy excludes the islands completely. The group sent a pre-litigation \u201cletter before action\u201d to the Dutch government last May, hoping to resolve the issue without going to

Research by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, commissioned by Greenpeace, shows sea-level rise is likely to permanently submerge parts of the island by 2050, a problem exacerbated by the loss of coral reefs as a natural buffer against the oceans warming and acidifying. The studies also concluded that the climate crisis would exacerbate health problems on the island and could ruin its cultural heritage and tourism industry. Bonaire is a popular diving destination, and the degradation of coral reefs could lead to the loss of the majority of dive sites, which it is estimated will reduce visitor numbers by more than 100,000. The group of islanders, most of whom still live on Bonaire and are Dutch citizens, want the Netherlands to tighten its climate goals, so it contributes its \u201cfair share\u201d to keep global heating below 1.5C above preindustrial levels, which would involve reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 \u2013 10 years earlier than its current target. They also want solid plans, developed with the islands\u2019 inhabitants, to protect Bonaire from the consequences of the climate emergeency, to ensure that islanders can continue to live there, and pass on their traditions and culture to their children. Not doing this, they argue, is a breach of their human rights, particularly their right to life, and respect for private and family life. Eefje de Kroon, the climate justice expert at Greenpeace Netherlands who is working on the case, noted that the Netherlands is known for its advanced water-management strategies on the mainland, but the government has done very little to study how the climate crisis will affect its Caribbean outposts and how they could be protected. The national adaptation strategy excludes the islands completely. The group sent a pre-litigation \u201cletter before action\u201d to the Dutch government last May, hoping to resolve the issue without going to court.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: reducing emissions, tighten climate goals, reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions\npolicy: Kigali Amendment on HFCs\ntechnology: coral reefs, advanced water-management strategies, greenhouse gas emissions"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710527596,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24","_session_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24"}
{"text":"At least 160 elephants have died as drought conditions hit Zimbabwe, and with hot, dry weather likely to continue, conservationists fear there could be more deaths to come. The elephants died between August and December last year in the 14,651 sq km Hwange national park, which is home to endangered elephants, buffalo, lions, cheetahs, giraffes and other species. At least six other elephants have recently been discovered dead outside the park in suspected poaching incidents. The Zimbabwe Parks &amp; Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks) confirmed the deaths of the elephants in the park, and attributed them to drought. Tinashe Farawo, a spokesperson for Zimparks, said on Tuesday: \u201cWe have been doing tests, and preliminary results show that they were dying due to starvation. Most of the animals were dying between 50m and 100m from water sources.\u201d The elephants that died were mostly young, old or sick, the park said. Persistent dry weather, droughts and prolonged dry periods are intensifying across southern Africa. In 2023, there was no rainfall between February and November in the Hwange park, said Trevor Lane, the co-founder and head of the Bhejane Trust conservation group inside Hwange. \u201cThere was low nutrition, very high temperatures and a shortage of water; this contributed to massive stress, and it might happen again in 2024,\u201d Lane

The elephants died between August and December last year in the 14,651 sq km Hwange national park, which is home to endangered elephants, buffalo, lions, cheetahs, giraffes and other species. At least six other elephants have recently been discovered dead outside the park in suspected poaching incidents. The Zimbabwe Parks &amp; Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks) confirmed the deaths of the elephants in the park, and attributed them to drought. Tinashe Farawo, a spokesperson for Zimparks, said on Tuesday: \u201cWe have been doing tests, and preliminary results show that they were dying due to starvation. Most of the animals were dying between 50m and 100m from water sources.\u201d The elephants that died were mostly young, old or sick, the park said. Persistent dry weather, droughts and prolonged dry periods are intensifying across southern Africa. In 2023, there was no rainfall between February and November in the Hwange park, said Trevor Lane, the co-founder and head of the Bhejane Trust conservation group inside Hwange. \u201cThere was low nutrition, very high temperatures and a shortage of water; this contributed to massive stress, and it might happen again in 2024,\u201d Lane said.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: conservationists fear more deaths to come, suspected poaching incidents\npolicy: \ntechnology: drought conditions, leveraging microorganisms for rejuvenation"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710527604,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24","_session_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24"}
{"text":"\u201cThat would be like a partial Amoc collapse, but unfolding faster and having profound impacts on the UK, western Europe, parts of North America, and the Sahel region, where the west African monsoon could be severely disrupted,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether this previously unaccounted source is enough freshwater to make a difference depends on how close we are to that subpolar gyre tipping point. Recent models suggest it could be close already at the present level of global warming.\u201d However, Prof Andrew Shepherd, at the University of Northumbria, UK, said: \u201cAlthough there was a step-change in glacier retreat at the turn of the century, it\u2019s reassuring to see that the pace of ice loss has been steady since then and is still well below the levels needed to disturb the Amoc.\u201d The discovery of the extra ice loss is also important for calculating the Earth\u2019s energy imbalance, ie how much extra solar heat the Earth is trapping due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, said Greene. \u201cIt takes a lot of energy to melt 1tn tonnes of ice. So if we want very precise energy balanced models for the Earth, this has to be accounted for.\u201d The glaciers analysed in the study were mostly below sea level already, so the lost ice was replaced by sea water and did not affect sea level directly. But Greene said: \u201cIt almost certainly has an indirect effect, by allowing glaciers to speed up. These narrow fjords are the bottleneck, so if you start carving away at the edges of the ice, it\u2019s like removing the plug in the drain.\u201d","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/17/greenland-losing-30m-tonnes-of-ice-an-hour-study-reveals_2","publication_date":"2024-01-17T16:00:34Z"},"_input_hash":-71627410,"_task_hash":16997434,"tokens":[{"text":"\u201c","start":0,"end":1,"id":0,"ws":false},{"text":"That","start":1,"end":5,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"would","start":6,"end":11,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":12,"end":14,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"like","start":15,"end":19,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":20,"end":21,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"partial","start":22,"end":29,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"Amoc","start":30,"end":34,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"collapse","start":35,"end":43,"id":8,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":43,"end":44,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"but","start":45,"end":48,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"unfolding","start":49,"end":58,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"faster","start":59,"end":65,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":66,"end":69,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"having","start":70,"end":76,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"profound","start":77,"end":85,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"impacts","start":86,"end":93,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":94,"end":96,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":97,"end":100,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"UK","start":101,"end":103,"id":19,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":103,"end":104,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"western","start":105,"end":112,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"Europe","start":113,"end":119,"id":22,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":119,"end":120,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"parts","start":121,"end":126,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":127,"end":129,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"North","start":130,"end":135,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"America","start":136,"end":143,"id":27,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":143,"end":144,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":145,"end":148,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":149,"end":152,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"Sahel","start":153,"end":158,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"region","start":159,"end":165,"id":32,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":165,"end":166,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"where","start":167,"end":172,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":173,"end":176,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"west","start":177,"end":181,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"African","start":182,"end":189,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"monsoon","start":190,"end":197,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"could","start":198,"end":203,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":204,"end":206,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"severely","start":207,"end":215,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"disrupted","start":216,"end":225,"id":42,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":225,"end":226,"id":43,"ws":false},{"text":"\u201d","start":226,"end":227,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"he","start":228,"end":230,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"said","start":231,"end":235,"id":46,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":235,"end":236,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"\u201c","start":237,"end":238,"id":48,"ws":false},{"text":"Whether","start":238,"end":245,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"this","start":246,"end":250,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"previously","start":251,"end":261,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"unaccounted","start":262,"end":273,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"source","start":274,"end":280,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":281,"end":283,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"enough","start":284,"end":290,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"freshwater","start":291,"end":301,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":302,"end":304,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"make","start":305,"end":309,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":310,"end":311,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"difference","start":312,"end":322,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"depends","start":323,"end":330,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":331,"end":333,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"how","start":334,"end":337,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"close","start":338,"end":343,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"we","start":344,"end":346,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":347,"end":350,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":351,"end":353,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":354,"end":358,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"subpolar","start":359,"end":367,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"gyre","start":368,"end":372,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"tipping","start":373,"end":380,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"point","start":381,"end":386,"id":72,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":386,"end":387,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"Recent","start":388,"end":394,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"models","start":395,"end":401,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"suggest","start":402,"end":409,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":410,"end":412,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"could","start":413,"end":418,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":419,"end":421,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"close","start":422,"end":427,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"already","start":428,"end":435,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"at","start":436,"end":438,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":439,"end":442,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"present","start":443,"end":450,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"level","s

Recent models suggest it could be close already at the present level of global warming.\u201d However, Prof Andrew Shepherd, at the University of Northumbria, UK, said: \u201cAlthough there was a step-change in glacier retreat at the turn of the century, it\u2019s reassuring to see that the pace of ice loss has been steady since then and is still well below the levels needed to disturb the Amoc.\u201d The discovery of the extra ice loss is also important for calculating the Earth\u2019s energy imbalance, ie how much extra solar heat the Earth is trapping due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, said Greene. \u201cIt takes a lot of energy to melt 1tn tonnes of ice. So if we want very precise energy balanced models for the Earth, this has to be accounted for.\u201d The glaciers analysed in the study were mostly below sea level already, so the lost ice was replaced by sea water and did not affect sea level directly. But Greene said: \u201cIt almost certainly has an indirect effect, by allowing glaciers to speed up. These narrow fjords are the bottleneck, so if you start carving away at the edges of the ice, it\u2019s like removing the plug in the drain.\u201d\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: \nmethod: Amoc collapse, glacier retreat, ice loss, energy imbalance, greenhouse gas emissions, sea level, fjords"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710527615,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24","_session_id":"2024-03-15_15-10-24"}

{"text":"According to a projection by the CCC, the mine would add 400,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions every year. The closure of the UK\u2019s last remaining blast furnaces, British Steel\u2019s site in Scunthorpe and Tata Steel\u2019s in Port Talbot, have cast further doubts on the case for the mine. Both companies have said they want to upgrade to electric arc furnaces and the government has pledged at least \u00a3500m towards Tata Steel\u2019s transition efforts, with similar levels of support expected for British Steel. Bosworth said: \u201cThe confusion over the government\u2019s policy on steel is astonishing. On the one hand the government claims the UK steel industry needs coal for decades to come, and on the other it is offering hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money to help the industry rapidly decarbonise. \u201cThis muddled government thinking has to stop. Ministers from every government department must accept that the steel industry is moving away from coal and withdraw support for this unnecessary and destructive mine.

The closure of the UK\u2019s last remaining blast furnaces, British Steel\u2019s site in Scunthorpe and Tata Steel\u2019s in Port Talbot, have cast further doubts on the case for the mine. Both companies have said they want to upgrade to electric arc furnaces and the government has pledged at least \u00a3500m towards Tata Steel\u2019s transition efforts, with similar levels of support expected for British Steel. Bosworth said: \u201cThe confusion over the government\u2019s policy on steel is astonishing. On the one hand the government claims the UK steel industry needs coal for decades to come, and on the other it is offering hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money to help the industry rapidly decarbonise. \u201cThis muddled government thinking has to stop. Ministers from every government department must accept that the steel industry is moving away from coal and withdraw support for this unnecessary and destructive mine. This would also help restore the UK\u2019s global credibility on climate change. \u201cMinisters should put areas like west Cumbria at the heart of a green industrial strategy, create new jobs and business opportunities and put the region at the forefront of building the cleaner future we urgently need.\u201d Friends of the Earth is currently taking the government to court over the new mine.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: upgrade to electric arc furnaces, transition efforts, decarbonise, green industrial strategy, create new jobs and business opportunities, building the cleaner future\npolicy: \ntechnology: electric arc furnaces"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710770404,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

{"text":"Now, the partnership faces a new stress test: the reality that in the climate-changed American west, there simply is not enough water to go around. Terminal or sink lakes such as Abert form at the lowest point of closed basins, which have no surface outlet. In the American west, there are only a few large and permanent terminal lakes, including Abert, the Great Salt Lake, Mono Lake and the Salton Sea. These closed-basin water systems are unusual because \u201cyou just get that one shot of water \u2013 what you see is what you have\u201d, says Colleen Withers, a seventh-generation rancher in the basin. Most of the water flowing into Abert comes via the Chewaucan River. As it carries snowmelt across the valley\u2019s steppe in the spring, ranchers divert the river into canals and flood grassy marshes where their cattle live during the winter and give birth to their young in the spring. Those irrigation systems date back to the early 1900s, but the diversions have increased over time. If all the water extraction rights on the Chewaucan were fully used now, they would exceed the river\u2019s flow. Climate change has also increased evaporation from the river and the lake. That is worrisome for conservationists and scientists because of its implications for shorebirds such as Wilson\u2019s phalaropes and American avocets that have adapted over time to live around saline lakes, learning to feed in ways that minimise their salt intake and evolving specialised glands above their eyes to excrete salts.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/05/salt-lake-migrating-birds-lake-abert-us_1","publication_date":"2024-03-05T15:04:42Z"},"_input_hash":-1006758847,"_task_hash":694616885,"tokens":[{"text":"Now","start":0,"end":3,"id":0,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":3,"end":4,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":5,"end":8,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"partnership","start":9,"end":20,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"faces","start":21,"end":26,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":27,"end":28,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"new","start":29,"end":32,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"stress","start":33,"end":39,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"test","start":40,"end":44,"id":8,"ws":false},{"text":":","start":44,"end":45,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":46,"end":49,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"reality","start":50,"end":57,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":58,"end":62,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":63,"end":65,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":66,"end":69,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"climate","start":70,"end":77,"id":15,"ws":false},{"text":"-","start":77,"end":78,"id":16,"ws":false},{"text":"changed","start":78,"end":85,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"American","start":86,"end":94,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"west","start":95,"end":99,"id":19,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":99,"end":100,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"there","start":101,"end":106,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"simply","start":107,"end":113,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":114,"end":116,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"not","start":117,"end":120,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"enough","start":121,"end":127,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"water","start":128,"end":133,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":134,"end":136,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"go","start":137,"end":139,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"around","start":140,"end":146,"id":29,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":146,"end":147,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"Terminal","start":148,"end":156,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"or","start":157,"end":159,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"sink","start":160,"end":164,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"lakes","start":165,"end":170,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"such","start":171,"end":175,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":176,"end":178,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"Abert","start":179,"end":184,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"form","start":185,"end":189,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"at","start":190,"end":192,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":193,"end":196,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"lowest","start":197,"end":203,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"point","start":204,"end":209,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":210,"end":212,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"closed","start":213,"end":219,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"basins","start":220,"end":226,"id":45,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":226,"end":227,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"which","start":228,"end":233,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"have","start":234,"end":238,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"no","start":239,"end":241,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"surface","start":242,"end":249,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"outlet","start":250,"end":256,"id":51,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":256,"end":257,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"In","start":258,"end":260,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":261,"end":264,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"American","start":265,"end":273,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"west","start":274,"end":278,"id":56,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":278,"end":279,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"there","start":280,"end":285,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":286,"end":289,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"only","start":290,"end":294,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":295,"end":296,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"few","start":297,"end":300,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"large","start":301,"end":306,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":307,"end":310,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"permanent","start":311,"end":320,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"terminal","start":321,"end":329,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"lakes","start":330,"end":335,"id":67,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":335,"end":336,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"including","start":337,"end":346,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"Abert","start":347,"end":352,"id":70,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":352,"end":353,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":354,"end":357,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"Great","start":358,"end":363,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"Salt","start":364,"end":368,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"Lake","start":369,"end":373,"id":75,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":373,"end":374,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"Mono","start":375,"end":379,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"Lake","start":380,"end":384,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":385,"end":388,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":389,"end":392,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"Salton","start":393,"end":399,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"Sea","start":400,"end":403,"id":82,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":403,"end":404,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"These","start":405,"end":410,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"closed","start":411,"end":417,"id":85,"ws":false},{"text":"-","start":417,"end":418,"i

Terminal or sink lakes such as Abert form at the lowest point of closed basins, which have no surface outlet. In the American west, there are only a few large and permanent terminal lakes, including Abert, the Great Salt Lake, Mono Lake and the Salton Sea. These closed-basin water systems are unusual because \u201cyou just get that one shot of water \u2013 what you see is what you have\u201d, says Colleen Withers, a seventh-generation rancher in the basin. Most of the water flowing into Abert comes via the Chewaucan River. As it carries snowmelt across the valley\u2019s steppe in the spring, ranchers divert the river into canals and flood grassy marshes where their cattle live during the winter and give birth to their young in the spring. Those irrigation systems date back to the early 1900s, but the diversions have increased over time. If all the water extraction rights on the Chewaucan were fully used now, they would exceed the river\u2019s flow. Climate change has also increased evaporation from the river and the lake. That is worrisome for conservationists and scientists because of its implications for shorebirds such as Wilson\u2019s phalaropes and American avocets that have adapted over time to live around saline lakes, learning to feed in ways that minimise their salt intake and evolving specialised glands above their eyes to excrete salts.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: irrigation systems, snowmelt, evaporation, saline lakes, conservationists, shorebirds, Wilson's phalaropes, American avocets"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710770470,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

{"text":"An eager crowd has gathered beside an old flooded claypit in the grounds of Maydencroft Manor to celebrate a royal arrival. Once owned by the crown, this estate is now a native breeds farm where English longhorn cattle are reared for conservation grazing. Although the medieval manor house has accommodated queens and knights over the centuries, today\u2019s noble guest has not enjoyed such luxurious surroundings. He\u2019s spent the week in a bucket of water in my garden shed. Our VIP (Very Important Poplar) is a male black poplar cutting from the royal estate at Sandringham, kindly donated by \u201cphantom tree planter\u201d Roger Jefcoate, to replace Hitchin\u2019s much-loved hybrid black poplar that toppled in storms last year. With the rugged magnificence of this fallen veteran in mind, it is with some trepidation that I face the group at the planting site, clutching an ostensibly dead stick. I explain that black poplars, like many floodplain trees, readily reproduce by vegetative means (often from fallen branches or windthrown trunks), so this hardwood cutting has a good chance of rooting. Yet, despite their resilience, black poplars (Populus nigra subsp.betulifolia) are one of the UK\u2019s most endangered tree species. Of the 7,719 recorded in the national database, only about 600 are female \u2013 rarely planted due to their copious production of fluffy seeds.

With the rugged magnificence of this fallen veteran in mind, it is with some trepidation that I face the group at the planting site, clutching an ostensibly dead stick. I explain that black poplars, like many floodplain trees, readily reproduce by vegetative means (often from fallen branches or windthrown trunks), so this hardwood cutting has a good chance of rooting. Yet, despite their resilience, black poplars (Populus nigra subsp.betulifolia) are one of the UK\u2019s most endangered tree species. Of the 7,719 recorded in the national database, only about 600 are female \u2013 rarely planted due to their copious production of fluffy seeds. Even worse, most are nearing the end of their 200-year lifespan and, due to the paucity of females and of wet alluvial soil needed for seeds to germinate, there\u2019s little evidence of sexual reproduction.\n'''"],"response":["project: Maydencroft Manor\ninitiative: conservation grazing, tree planting\npolicy: \ntechnology: claypit, floodplain trees, hardwood cutting, black poplars"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710770504,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"The impact of artificial snow use for up to 100 consecutive days would raise water consumption by about 540m litres of water and pitch resorts against local communities because of competition over water use. In the French Alps water consumption could increase ninefold by 2100 from this reliance on artificial snow, according to the study. The federation said only by using carbon offsetting would it be possible to meet the 1.5c target of the Paris Agreement; and it had created the FIS Rainforest Initiative to do so. So while some are pushing for the industry to do more to adapt to keep the sport alive, others are working to embrace a new future rather than concentrating everything on the one sport. In Morzine, the non-profit sustainability Montagne Verte group is working at grassroots level to support a move to a low-carbon future in the area. C\u00e9cile Burton, general manager of Montagne Verte, said: \u201cTemperatures in the Alps are rising at more than twice the global average and that is not good news for an industry dependent on snow. \u201cOur approach is to focus on four-season tourism in the valley and to make the valley and mountains somewhere you can live all year. \u201cThere is life after skiing but we have to adapt and we have to imagine what our future will look like. This is an area where you can climb, mountain bike, walk, or just be in the environment and that is all year round. \u201cWe need to put more value in other times of the year not only from an environmental and sustainability perspective but from a human perspective because for somewhere to be a place you can live in all year round you have to have employment all year

In the French Alps water consumption could increase ninefold by 2100 from this reliance on artificial snow, according to the study. The federation said only by using carbon offsetting would it be possible to meet the 1.5c target of the Paris Agreement; and it had created the FIS Rainforest Initiative to do so. So while some are pushing for the industry to do more to adapt to keep the sport alive, others are working to embrace a new future rather than concentrating everything on the one sport. In Morzine, the non-profit sustainability Montagne Verte group is working at grassroots level to support a move to a low-carbon future in the area. C\u00e9cile Burton, general manager of Montagne Verte, said: \u201cTemperatures in the Alps are rising at more than twice the global average and that is not good news for an industry dependent on snow. \u201cOur approach is to focus on four-season tourism in the valley and to make the valley and mountains somewhere you can live all year. \u201cThere is life after skiing but we have to adapt and we have to imagine what our future will look like. This is an area where you can climb, mountain bike, walk, or just be in the environment and that is all year round. \u201cWe need to put more value in other times of the year not only from an environmental and sustainability perspective but from a human perspective because for somewhere to be a place you can live in all year round you have to have employment all year round.\u201d\n'''"],"response":["initiative: FIS Rainforest Initiative, low-carbon future, four-season tourism\npolicy: Paris Agreement\nproject: \ntechnology: artificial snow, carbon offsetting, low-carbon future"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710770555,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"The shadow cabinet and Labour\u2019s top advisers are considering whether to alter or even abandon the longstanding pledge to increase public investment in the low-carbon economy to \u00a328bn a year in the second half of the next parliament. The Tory party has made the pledge its key attack line against Labour, claiming that the only way the party will be able to make such investments is by raising taxes. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is expected to attempt to reinforce this by cutting some taxes in the budget in March, further reducing the fiscal headroom an incoming Labour government would have to increase spending, unless it rowed back on his cuts. The Tories also argue that their plans, which include scaling up fossil fuels by issuing more oil and gas licences, are already attracting private sector investment. Private sector investment in the UK\u2019s low-carbon economy since 2010 stands at \u00a3200bn, with \u00a330bn of that coming since September, mainly in offshore wind. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThis shows huge confidence in the UK, and our plans will see a further \u00a3100bn [in private sector investment] by 2030, helping to support up to 480,000 jobs.\u201d A Whitehall source said the government\u2019s roadmaps on industries such as nuclear power, carbon capture and hydrogen were \u201cproviding industry with the certainty they need to back low-carbon projects in the UK\u201d. Maier, however, said the government needed to intervene much more in the market to attract the levels of investment needed for a low-carbon economy. He also cast doubt on its current strategy, pointing to the closure of the Port Talbot steelworks despite previous assurances that it would stay open, and failures to invest in the electricity grid, high-speed rail and manufacturing.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/31/business-leader-urges-labour-to-stand-by-28bn-pledge-for-green-economy_1","publication_date":"2024-01-31T13:00:23Z"},"_input_hash":-1019316687,"_task_hash":-116348507,"tokens":[{"text":"The","start":0,"end":3,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"shadow","start":4,"end":10,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"cabinet","start":11,"end":18,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":19,"end":22,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"Labour","start":23,"end":29,"id":4,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":29,"end":31,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"top","start":32,"end":35,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"advisers","start":36,"end":44,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":45,"end":48,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"considering","start":49,"end":60,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"whether","start":61,"end":68,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":69,"end":71,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"alter","start":72,"end":77,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"or","start":78,"end":80,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"even","start":81,"end":85,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"abandon","start":86,"end":93,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":94,"end":97,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"longstanding","start":98,"end":110,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"pledge","start":111,"end":117,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":118,"end":120,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"increase","start":121,"end":129,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"public","start":130,"end":136,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"investment","start":137,"end":147,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":148,"end":150,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":151,"end":154,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"low","start":155,"end":158,"id":25,"ws":false},{"text":"-","start":158,"end":159,"id":26,"ws":false},{"text":"carbon","start":159,"end":165,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"economy","start":166,"end":173,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":174,"end":176,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"\u00a3","start":177,"end":178,"id":30,"ws":false},{"text":"28bn","start":178,"end":182,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":183,"end":184,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"year","start":185,"end":189,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":190,"end":192,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":193,"end":196,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"second","start":197,"end":203,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"half","start":204,"end":208,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":209,"end":211,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":212,"end":215,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"next","start":216,"end":220,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"parliament","start":221,"end":231,"id":41,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":231,"end":232,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"The","start":233,"end":236,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"Tory","start":237,"end":241,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"party","start":242,"end":247,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"has","start":248,"end":251,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"made","start":252,"end":256,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":257,"end":260,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"pledge","start":261,"end":267,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"its","start":268,"end":271,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"key","start":272,"end":275,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"attack","start":276,"end":282,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"line","start":283,"end":287,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"against","start":288,"end":295,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"Labour","start":296,"end":302,"id":55,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":302,"end":303,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"claiming","start":304,"end":312,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":313,"end":317,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":318,"end":321,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"only","start":322,"end":326,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"way","start":327,"end":330,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":331,"end":334,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"party","start":335,"end":340,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"will","start":341,"end":345,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":346,"end":348,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"able","start":349,"end":353,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":354,"end":356,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"make","start":357,"end":361,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"such","start":362,"end":366,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"investments","start":367,"end":378,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":379,"end":381,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":382,"end":384,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"raising","start":385,"end":392,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"taxes","start":393,"end":398,"id":74,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":398,"end":399,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"The","start":400,"end":403,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"chancellor","start":404,"end":414,"id":77,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":414,"end":415,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"Jeremy","start":416,"end":422,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"Hunt","start":423,"end":427,"id":80,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":427,"end":428,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":429,"end":431,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"expected","start":432,"end":440,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":441,"end":443,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"a

The Tory party has made the pledge its key attack line against Labour, claiming that the only way the party will be able to make such investments is by raising taxes. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is expected to attempt to reinforce this by cutting some taxes in the budget in March, further reducing the fiscal headroom an incoming Labour government would have to increase spending, unless it rowed back on his cuts. The Tories also argue that their plans, which include scaling up fossil fuels by issuing more oil and gas licences, are already attracting private sector investment. Private sector investment in the UK\u2019s low-carbon economy since 2010 stands at \u00a3200bn, with \u00a330bn of that coming since September, mainly in offshore wind. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThis shows huge confidence in the UK, and our plans will see a further \u00a3100bn [in private sector investment] by 2030, helping to support up to 480,000 jobs.\u201d A Whitehall source said the government\u2019s roadmaps on industries such as nuclear power, carbon capture and hydrogen were \u201cproviding industry with the certainty they need to back low-carbon projects in the UK\u201d. Maier, however, said the government needed to intervene much more in the market to attract the levels of investment needed for a low-carbon economy. He also cast doubt on its current strategy, pointing to the closure of the Port Talbot steelworks despite previous assurances that it would stay open, and failures to invest in the electricity grid, high-speed rail and manufacturing.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: increase public investment in the low-carbon economy, scaling up fossil fuels, issuing more oil and gas licences, attracting private sector investment\npolicy: \ntechnology: offshore wind, nuclear power, carbon capture, hydrogen, electricity grid, high-speed rail"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710770603,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

{"text":"Fire ants could sting 8.6 million Australians a year if they were to become endemic \u2013 but a pathogenic fungus and pesticide-loaded drones might help avert that scenario, according to submissions posed to the federal government\u2019s fire ants inquiry. Submissions to the Senate inquiry into red imported fire ants (Rifa) in Australia closed on Monday, just days after the latest in a string of fire ant detections beyond south-east Queensland, where an infestation of the invasive pest is ongoing. Last week a single fire ant was found in an Australia Post package of plant material sent to Tasmania from Queensland. The non-reproductive female was detected by Biosecurity Tasmania as part of \u201cbusiness-as-usual surveillance operations at mail centres across the state\u201d. In late January a fire ant nest was found in Wardell in northern New South Wales, while five nests were discovered in Murwillumbah, 13km south of the Queensland border, in November. It was the first time fire ants had crossed the Queensland border into NSW since the infestation began in 2001. The fire ants\u2019 march south has prompted a range of government, agricultural, health and research bodies and individuals to use the inquiry to call for resources and education to help stamp out the pest. Fire ant stings can cause anaphylaxis and death in humans. They can also damage electrical and agricultural equipment, kill native plants and damage ecosystems beyond repair. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In a joint submission to the rural and regional affairs and transport references

Submissions to the Senate inquiry into red imported fire ants (Rifa) in Australia closed on Monday, just days after the latest in a string of fire ant detections beyond south-east Queensland, where an infestation of the invasive pest is ongoing. Last week a single fire ant was found in an Australia Post package of plant material sent to Tasmania from Queensland. The non-reproductive female was detected by Biosecurity Tasmania as part of \u201cbusiness-as-usual surveillance operations at mail centres across the state\u201d. In late January a fire ant nest was found in Wardell in northern New South Wales, while five nests were discovered in Murwillumbah, 13km south of the Queensland border, in November. It was the first time fire ants had crossed the Queensland border into NSW since the infestation began in 2001. The fire ants\u2019 march south has prompted a range of government, agricultural, health and research bodies and individuals to use the inquiry to call for resources and education to help stamp out the pest. Fire ant stings can cause anaphylaxis and death in humans. They can also damage electrical and agricultural equipment, kill native plants and damage ecosystems beyond repair. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In a joint submission to the rural and regional affairs and transport references committee, the National Allergy Centre of Excellence and Allergy and Anaphylaxis Australia predicted that if fire ants were to become endemic, a quarter of the 8.6 million Australians who would be stung by fire ants each year would develop an allergic reaction, with 174,000 of those requiring medical attention.\n'''"],"response":["project: fire ants inquiry\ninitiative: resources and education to help stamp out the pest\npolicy: \ntechnology: pathogenic fungus, pesticide-loaded drones, Biosecurity Tasmania, electrical and agricultural equipment"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710770676,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"Farmers often feel ignored by Westminster politicians. Now, however, as a general election heaves slowly into view and the fight for the rural vote begins, it was not a huge surprise when the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, turned up at their annual conference. Sunak told farmers: \u201cI have your back\u201d and waxed nostalgic about the bucolic British countryside and his experience milking a cow. But after years of very unpopular post-Brexit trade deals and a bungled agricultural transition from EU farming payments, it didn\u2019t feel like this charm offensive landed. The response from the farmers in the hall was muted at best. Minette Batters, the outgoing president of the NFU, gave both barrels in her speech immediately before Sunak on the \u201cmorally bankrupt\u201d decisions made by Conservatives over recent years. She seemed also to take Sunak\u2019s proclamations of love for the British farming sector with a pinch of salt. It\u2019s no surprise to see the Tories turning up here. Farmers have long been one of the most stalwart cores of the rural conservative vote, but recent polling by the Country Land and Business Association found that people in rural areas are defecting to Labour in huge numbers, with the party\u2019s share of the vote having climbed to 37%, up 17 points on the 2019 general election result, and the Conservatives\u2019 share falling 25 points to 34%. The Conservatives hold 96 of the 100 most rural seats, but they face losing more than half to Labour and the Liberal Democrats, including those of Jacob Rees-Mogg, Jeremy Hunt and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se

Now, however, as a general election heaves slowly into view and the fight for the rural vote begins, it was not a huge surprise when the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, turned up at their annual conference. Sunak told farmers: \u201cI have your back\u201d and waxed nostalgic about the bucolic British countryside and his experience milking a cow. But after years of very unpopular post-Brexit trade deals and a bungled agricultural transition from EU farming payments, it didn\u2019t feel like this charm offensive landed. The response from the farmers in the hall was muted at best. Minette Batters, the outgoing president of the NFU, gave both barrels in her speech immediately before Sunak on the \u201cmorally bankrupt\u201d decisions made by Conservatives over recent years. She seemed also to take Sunak\u2019s proclamations of love for the British farming sector with a pinch of salt. It\u2019s no surprise to see the Tories turning up here. Farmers have long been one of the most stalwart cores of the rural conservative vote, but recent polling by the Country Land and Business Association found that people in rural areas are defecting to Labour in huge numbers, with the party\u2019s share of the vote having climbed to 37%, up 17 points on the 2019 general election result, and the Conservatives\u2019 share falling 25 points to 34%. The Conservatives hold 96 of the 100 most rural seats, but they face losing more than half to Labour and the Liberal Democrats, including those of Jacob Rees-Mogg, Jeremy Hunt and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: fight for the rural vote, agricultural transition\npolicy: post-Brexit trade deals\ntechnology: EU farming payments"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710770722,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"\u201cSo I went for a diagnosis. Just to understand it and learn how to deal with it.\u201d For someone who admits to once being shy to the point of antisocial, Ronayne is an engaging public speaker who effortlessly imparts his own wonderment at each new discovery he makes to the audiences that now fill local halls in Ireland to hear him speak. He tells me of a recent speaking event he held at \u201ca festival in Wicklow where people primarily wanted to party, yet the marquee was packed\u201d. Afterwards, he led a guided walk through the nearby fields and the entire audience followed in his wake. It was, he says, \u201can extraordinarily powerful and moving moment\u201d. Ronayne is about to release a digital-only ambient album, Wild Silence, comprising 15-minute tracks that, he says, \u201ccapture the sound of a whole habitat free from human noise\u201d. It includes a soundscape of a dawn chorus that begins with a single cuckoo and builds as other birds awaken and join in, and another of a more intimate ritual recorded in the entrance of a puffin

{"text":"The government\u2019s failure to insulate the UK\u2019s cold and leaky homes is costing thousands of lives a year, according to analysis. The report from Greenpeace reveals 58 people have died due to cold homes every day on average during the winter since David Cameron\u2019s Conservative government decided to \u201ccut the green crap\u201d in 2013 \u2013 drastically slashing support for home insulation. Paul Morozzo, Greenpeace UK\u2019s fuel poverty campaigner, said: \u201cThousands of people are literally freezing to death in their own homes during winter. And not only have successive governments failed to prevent this needless and shocking loss of life but they have fuelled this silent public health crisis by slashing insulation funding and failing to deliver a proper scheme to upgrade our cold, damp, draughty homes.\u201d Morozzo said tackling cold and damp homes would not only save lives but would reduce bills, tackling fuel poverty and the cost of living crisis as well as reducing carbon emissions. The Labour party had pledged to invest the \u00a36bn a year that experts including Greenpeace say is required to tackle the UK\u2019s housing stock. But it recently scaled back its spending plans for insulating homes by more than 70%. To mark the launch of the report, Greenpeace activists turned a royal park outside the Houses of Parliament in London into a mock cemetery on Wednesday morning, erecting hundreds of headstones made from insulation boards. Activists pointed out that the UK had some of the least energy-efficient housing in western

The report from Greenpeace reveals 58 people have died due to cold homes every day on average during the winter since David Cameron\u2019s Conservative government decided to \u201ccut the green crap\u201d in 2013 \u2013 drastically slashing support for home insulation. Paul Morozzo, Greenpeace UK\u2019s fuel poverty campaigner, said: \u201cThousands of people are literally freezing to death in their own homes during winter. And not only have successive governments failed to prevent this needless and shocking loss of life but they have fuelled this silent public health crisis by slashing insulation funding and failing to deliver a proper scheme to upgrade our cold, damp, draughty homes.\u201d Morozzo said tackling cold and damp homes would not only save lives but would reduce bills, tackling fuel poverty and the cost of living crisis as well as reducing carbon emissions. The Labour party had pledged to invest the \u00a36bn a year that experts including Greenpeace say is required to tackle the UK\u2019s housing stock. But it recently scaled back its spending plans for insulating homes by more than 70%. To mark the launch of the report, Greenpeace activists turned a royal park outside the Houses of Parliament in London into a mock cemetery on Wednesday morning, erecting hundreds of headstones made from insulation boards. Activists pointed out that the UK had some of the least energy-efficient housing in western Europe.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: cut the green crap, upgrade our cold, damp, draughty homes, tackling fuel poverty, reducing carbon emissions\npolicy: \ntechnology: insulation, energy-efficient housing"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710770798,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"\u201cWe have been able to keep the water levels and also the groundwater levels within very tight ranges, but we now foresee that that will be impossible in future. So our water boards already say to new developers: we need more space for water storage and we need more flexibility for water level variations, more fluctuation potential, larger freeboard, so stay out of the wet areas. And we need more room for storage and discharge.\u201d A \u20ac2.3bn \u201cRoom for the River\u201d project \u2013 making floodplains at more than 30 locations on four rivers \u2013 is credited with saving the country from the worst flooding this year. The national delta programme is investing in action to guard until 2050, and a multi-billion euro flood protection programme (HWPB) involves 100 projects to strengthen kilometres of dykes, without which, says Rijkswaterstaat infrastructure organisation, 60% of the country would regularly be under water. But in cities, too, water protection must meet urban design to create an attractive, adaptive city, says Arnoud Molenaar, Rotterdam\u2019s chief resilience officer. A vast amount of work has been going on, and the city has built water squares, green and blue roofs and a 2km-long railway viaduct rooftop park. The water squares, also designed by De Urbanisten, are, very simply, built in overflow areas \u2013 when there is too much rainwater they fill up, and then slowly drain away so that the storm drains are not overwhelmed. And when the water has gone, they become public spaces again. \u201cThe most important thing is that we are not investing in regret measures,\u201d says

But in cities, too, water protection must meet urban design to create an attractive, adaptive city, says Arnoud Molenaar, Rotterdam\u2019s chief resilience officer. A vast amount of work has been going on, and the city has built water squares, green and blue roofs and a 2km-long railway viaduct rooftop park. The water squares, also designed by De Urbanisten, are, very simply, built in overflow areas \u2013 when there is too much rainwater they fill up, and then slowly drain away so that the storm drains are not overwhelmed.

{"text":"A middle-class family on holiday on Long Island are disturbed by a black couple who claim to own the Airbnb they are staying in. They say there has been an electricity blackout in New York. The phone, TV and internet won\u2019t work, animals are fleeing, and gradually, the family realise there may have been an apocalyptic event \u2013 a world-altering calamity \u2013 that they do not know about. Our critics said the book was a \u201cpage-turning thriller\u201d about class, race, indecision and the agonies of parenting in the midst of an unfolding catastrophe \u2013 and gave the 2023 Netflix film, which stars Julia Roberts and Mahershala Ali, four stars. The Children of Men by PD James (1992) Published in 1992, the novel imagines 2021 in an England where democracy was abolished because the human race has been infertile for 27 years and the population is steadily declining. Young people are worshipped for their youth, while elderly people are seen as a burden and are sometimes forced to take part in mass drownings. But as childless men wrestle for power, it emerges that one woman is hiding a very precious secret.

{"text":"The first butterfly of the year is usually a heart-lifting sign of spring. Now it\u2019s arriving in midwinter. Spotting a lemon-yellow male brimstone jauntily cruising along a hedge filled with the bridal-white flowers of blackthorn is when spring starts for me, and that\u2019s usually in mid-March. This year, I saw one in Surrey on 15 February alongside the blossoming blackthorn and cherry plum. My first butterfly of the year turned up on New Year\u2019s Day: a red admiral, enjoying our extremely mild midwinter. For those who feel alarm, brimstones are very capable of coming and going in early spring, when fine weather visits for a day and vanishes for a fortnight. I haven\u2019t actually seen a brimstone around my Norfolk home yet, and each year first sightings are often only followed by more a month later. The key question is whether spring species can adapt, or whether mild extremes disrupt crucial synchronicities between caterpillars and food plants. The naturalist Matthew Oates has found purple emperor larvae losing their brown winter camouflage and turning green for spring, which usually happens in April. \u201cHopefully they know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he says.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/29/butterflywatch-brimstones-in-midwinter-raise-adaptability-issues_0","publication_date":"2024-02-29T06:00:08Z"},"_input_hash":1907584808,"_task_hash":-1686777645,"tokens":[{"text":"The","start":0,"end":3,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"first","start":4,"end":9,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"butterfly","start":10,"end":19,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":20,"end":22,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":23,"end":26,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"year","start":27,"end":31,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":32,"end":34,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"usually","start":35,"end":42,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":43,"end":44,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"heart","start":45,"end":50,"id":9,"ws":false},{"text":"-","start":50,"end":51,"id":10,"ws":false},{"text":"lifting","start":51,"end":58,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"sign","start":59,"end":63,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":64,"end":66,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"spring","start":67,"end":73,"id":14,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":73,"end":74,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"Now","start":75,"end":78,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":79,"end":81,"id":17,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":81,"end":83,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"arriving","start":84,"end":92,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":93,"end":95,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"midwinter","start":96,"end":105,"id":21,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":105,"end":106,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"Spotting","start":107,"end":115,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":116,"end":117,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"lemon","start":118,"end":123,"id":25,"ws":false},{"text":"-","start":123,"end":124,"id":26,"ws":false},{"text":"yellow","start":124,"end":130,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"male","start":131,"end":135,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"brimstone","start":136,"end":145,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"jauntily","start":146,"end":154,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"cruising","start":155,"end":163,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"along","start":164,"end":169,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":170,"end":171,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"hedge","start":172,"end":177,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"filled","start":178,"end":184,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":185,"end":189,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":190,"end":193,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"bridal","start":194,"end":200,"id":38,"ws":false},{"text":"-","start":200,"end":201,"id":39,"ws":false},{"text":"white","start":201,"end":206,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"flowers","start":207,"end":214,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":215,"end":217,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"blackthorn","start":218,"end":228,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":229,"end":231,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"when","start":232,"end":236,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"spring","start":237,"end":243,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"starts","start":244,"end":250,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":251,"end":254,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"me","start":255,"end":257,"id":49,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":257,"end":258,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":259,"end":262,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":263,"end":267,"id":52,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":267,"end":269,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"usually","start":270,"end":277,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":278,"end":280,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"mid","start":281,"end":284,"id":56,"ws":false},{"text":"-","start":284,"end":285,"id":57,"ws":false},{"text":"March","start":285,"end":290,"id":58,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":290,"end":291,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"This","start":292,"end":296,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"year","start":297,"end":301,"id":61,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":301,"end":302,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"I","start":303,"end":304,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"saw","start":305,"end":308,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"one","start":309,"end":312,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":313,"end":315,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"Surrey","start":316,"end":322,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":323,"end":325,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"15","start":326,"end":328,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"February","start":329,"end":337,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"alongside","start":338,"end":347,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":348,"end":351,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"blossoming","start":352,"end":362,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"blackthorn","start":363,"end":373,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":374,"end":377,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"cherry","start":378,"end":384,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"plum","start":385,"end":389,"id":77,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":389,"end":390,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"My","start":391,"end":393,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"first","start":394,"end":399,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"butterfly","start":400,"end":409,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":410,"end":412,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":413,"end":416,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"year","start":417,"end":421,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"turned","start":422,"end":428,"id

{"text":"Whenever we reach the bottom of this hill, Sitka spruce plantation on one side, hawthorn, alder and willow woodland on the other, the bird call app on my phone detects great spotted woodpeckers nearby. We seldom see them. They have a talent for hiding behind tree trunks when there are people around. What usually follows can often be a game of hide-and-seek, unless I\u2019m with an accomplice who walks around the tree and bamboozles the bird into breaking cover. But this hungry bird, approaching with characteristic woodpecker-riding-a-rollercoaster undulating flight, had no such inhibitions. She was carrying a spruce cone in her beak and landed in full view, on the trunk of a sallow. Then she wedged the cone into a hole she had already excavated, using that as a vice while she chiselled out the seeds. Later we found scores of discarded, hacked-about Sitka cones under her workbench. Sitka spruce \u2013 a fast-growing north American tree, generally unloved by the British public for perhaps understandable reasons \u2013 will forever be associated with dense forestry plantations blanketing upland landscapes, perceived to be devoid of wildlife.

This study is a very useful first step but more work is essential. \u201cThe research is not intended as regulatory monitoring \u2013 as such the names and site locations were not required for this particular work, which was carried out by a contractor on our behalf.\u201d However, the admission that the locations of the landfills are not known to Defra and the Environment Agency has shocked experts. Dr Shubhi Sharma, scientific research assistant at campaign group Chem Trust, said it was \u201cextremely worrying\u201d that the Environment Agency \u201cclaims not to know the locations of landfills where high levels of PFAS have been found in leachate\u201d. \u201cHow can action be taken by the Environment Agency and others to deal with the contamination of local groundwater and soil if they don\u2019t know the source of it? Workers, local residents and businesses have a right to know if their workplace or local area is polluted with toxic chemicals,\u201d she added. Penelope Gane, the head of practice at campaign group Fish Legal, said: \u201cYou would have thought that someone in the Environment Agency would be sitting up and taking notice with PFAS readings coming back hundreds of times higher than safe limits for drinking.

{"text":"Hydrologist Hannah Cloke has a straightforward description of the inundation that has just struck Britain. \u201cOur decorations may have come down but the flood warning map is currently lit up like a Christmas tree.\u201d And the immediate cause of this mayhem is clear. A sequence of storms this autumn and winter \u2013 Babet, Ciar\u00e1n, Debi, Elin, Fergus and Gerrit \u2013 have turned Britain into \u201ca sopping wet sponge\u201d, as the Reading University researcher put it. Then came Storm Henk last week. Its intense rainfall had nowhere to go except to pour into our rivers, which burst their banks spectacularly across the country. More than 1,000 homes in England were flooded and some villages totally cut off, with Nottinghamshire, Shropshire, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire worst affected.

Heather\u2019s a pleasure to watch when she\u2019s playing a room.\u201d * * * After public meetings like the one in the Shropshire hotel, Wildman holds private family sessions. These are two-hour sit-downs, always held at the farm and involving as many members of the family as can attend. There, over tea and snacks, Wildman gets them to talk about all the never-spoken high-stakes stuff, the slammed doors and unasked questions: who carries on only because carrying on seems less exhausting than stopping, who secretly wants to just take the money and run far, far away? Who only keeps going for fear of waking the ancestral gods, the cold generations who ploughed in the old lesson: however bad things get, never sell, never sell, never sell? In late July, I spent three days shadowing Wildman on some of her farm visits \u2013 nine farms, all in the Scottish Borders, all sizes, all family businesses. These meetings were part of a series of scheduled farm-business health checks. (Wildman\u2019s work is supported by a charitable fund, and this service is offered for free. I was allowed to tag along on the condition that I would anonymise the names of the families she met.)\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: farm visits, farm-business health checks\npolicy: \ntechnology: soil science, microorganisms, crop yields, ancestral gods"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710771002,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

{"text":"Toxic emissions from the Canadian tar sands \u2013 already one of the dirtiest fossil fuels \u2013 have been dramatically underestimated, according to a study. Research published in the journal Science found that air pollution from the vast Athabasca oil sands in Canada exceed industry-reported emissions across the studied facilities by a staggering 1,900% to over 6,300%. Academics said this means that damaging reactive pollutants from the oil sands are equivalent to those from all other human-made sources across Canada with severe health implications. Keith Stewart, a senior energy strategist for Greenpeace Canada, said: \u201cIn quantifying the astonishing and largely unreported levels of health-damaging air pollution coming out of oil sands operations, these scientists have validated what downwind Indigenous communities have been saying for decades. This is making people sick, so our governments can and should require these companies to use some of their record-breaking profits to clean up the mess they\u2019ve made.\u201d Canadian tar sands, also called oil sands, are a massive site of oil extraction in the province of Alberta. They cover an area larger than England, are one of the biggest industrial projects on the planet, and have seen record production levels this year. The type of oil in the tar sands is called \u201cbitumen\u201d. It is extremely heavy and difficult to extract. Getting it from deep in the ground to the surface can use up massive amounts of water \u2013 enough to rival what a small city may use on a daily

Research published in the journal Science found that air pollution from the vast Athabasca oil sands in Canada exceed industry-reported emissions across the studied facilities by a staggering 1,900% to over 6,300%. Academics said this means that damaging reactive pollutants from the oil sands are equivalent to those from all other human-made sources across Canada with severe health implications. Keith Stewart, a senior energy strategist for Greenpeace Canada, said: \u201cIn quantifying the astonishing and largely unreported levels of health-damaging air pollution coming out of oil sands operations, these scientists have validated what downwind Indigenous communities have been saying for decades. This is making people sick, so our governments can and should require these companies to use some of their record-breaking profits to clean up the mess they\u2019ve made.\u201d Canadian tar sands, also called oil sands, are a massive site of oil extraction in the province of Alberta. They cover an area larger than England, are one of the biggest industrial projects on the planet, and have seen record production levels this year. The type of oil in the tar sands is called \u201cbitumen\u201d. It is extremely heavy and difficult to extract. Getting it from deep in the ground to the surface can use up massive amounts of water \u2013 enough to rival what a small city may use on a daily basis.\n'''"],"response":["project: Canadian tar sands\ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: fossil fuels, oil sands, bitumen\nmethod: air pollution control, oil extraction, water usage"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710771030,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

Sydney, with a record going back to 1858, had its equal second warmest year on record for maximum temperatures. Canberra, Hobart, Brisbane, Perth and Darwin also experienced maximum temperatures that ranked in the top 10 for all years. Sea surface temperatures around the continent were the seventh-warmest on record and 0.54C above the average between 1961 and 1990, the bureau said.

{"text":"In a year of record-breaking temperatures and marine heatwaves threatening our already depleted seas, conservationists, supermarkets and even musicians, including Icelandic singer Bj\u00f6rk, have spoken out over dwindling wild fish populations. Oceana, a US-based NGO, reported that half of Britain\u2019s largest wild fish populations, including North Sea cod, are either overfished or in a critical state; supermarkets criticised the UK, Norway and EU for failure to reach agreement over sustainable mackerel fishing; and Blue Marine Foundation, another charity, is taking the UK government to court for \u201cillegally squandering\u201d fish populations by ignoring scientific advice on those shared with the EU and Norway. The welfare of farmed fish, as well as the impact of the fish farming industry, has also taken a hit. The naturalist and broadcaster Chris Packham called for a halt to the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d expansion of the Scottish salmon farming industry, as the Guardian revealed farmed salmon mortality was at record levels. Most salmon bought in UK supermarkets are farmed. And earlier this month, an expert assessment of wild fish populations found nearly a quarter at risk of extinction, with wild Atlantic salmon increasingly threatened. So, what are the fish to ditch in 2024 and what should we eating? \u201cUnsustainable seafood is one of the biggest threats to our seas,\u201d says Charlotte Coombes, good fish guide manager at the Marine Conservation Society (MCS).

Oceana, a US-based NGO, reported that half of Britain\u2019s largest wild fish populations, including North Sea cod, are either overfished or in a critical state; supermarkets criticised the UK, Norway and EU for failure to reach agreement over sustainable mackerel fishing; and Blue Marine Foundation, another charity, is taking the UK government to court for \u201cillegally squandering\u201d fish populations by ignoring scientific advice on those shared with the EU and Norway. The welfare of farmed fish, as well as the impact of the fish farming industry, has also taken a hit. The naturalist and broadcaster Chris Packham called for a halt to the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d expansion of the Scottish salmon farming industry, as the Guardian revealed farmed salmon mortality was at record levels. Most salmon bought in UK supermarkets are farmed. And earlier this month, an expert assessment of wild fish populations found nearly a quarter at risk of extinction, with wild Atlantic salmon increasingly threatened. So, what are the fish to ditch in 2024 and what should we eating? \u201cUnsustainable seafood is one of the biggest threats to our seas,\u201d says Charlotte Coombes, good fish guide manager at the Marine Conservation Society (MCS). The guide\u2019s latest edition, in October, awarded only one in eight UK fish the highest \u201cgreen\u201d status and considered only 13% a sustainable choice. Consumers should ask \u201cwhat, where and how\u201d, says Coombes \u2013 what species, where it was caught and how.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: spoken out over dwindling wild fish populations, taking the UK government to court for \u201cillegally squandering\u201d fish populations\npolicy: \ntechnology: fish farming industry, farmed salmon"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710771145,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

{"text":"But no matter how well intentioned the proposal might be, some environmental groups are alarmed at the direction of travel. \u201cThere\u2019s a real risk that mandating UNEP to write a report and set up an expert group on SRM could undermine the existing de facto moratorium on geoengineering and inadvertently provide legitimacy for delaying actions to phase out fossil fuels,\u201d said Mary Church of the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL). \u201cThere are some areas that the international community has rightly decided are simply off limits, like eugenics, human cloning and chemical weapons. Solar geoengineering belongs on that list and needs to join it fast, before seemingly harmless conversations on governance lead us down a very slippery slope towards deployment.\u201d Switzerland last proposed scrutiny of geoengineering at the 2019 UN environment assembly in 2019 but the topic was blocked by the United States and Saudi Arabia. Sources said this was because they wanted to conduct research into these technologies unfettered by international oversight or regulations. Since then, the debate on sun-dimming research has intensified and widened. In the past, this was an area partly funded by the fossil fuel industry, but in recent years, more actors have become involved, including philanthropists, financiers and hi-tech entrepreneurs, motivated by potential lucrative rewards and growing alarm about climate dangers. More money is flowing into the sector particularly in the United States, where Bill Gates is among supporters of the Harvard solar geoengineering research program, and groups such as the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Environmental Defense Fund, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and the Natural Resources Defense Council have expressed support for further studies into sunlight reflection technologies. The sector sometimes evinces a wild-west, make-up-the-rules-as-you-go-along, profiteering spirit, most evident in the US start-up Make Sunsets, which is already selling \u201ccooling credits\u201d and

Solar geoengineering belongs on that list and needs to join it fast, before seemingly harmless conversations on governance lead us down a very slippery slope towards deployment.\u201d Switzerland last proposed scrutiny of geoengineering at the 2019 UN environment assembly in 2019 but the topic was blocked by the United States and Saudi Arabia. Sources said this was because they wanted to conduct research into these technologies unfettered by international oversight or regulations. Since then, the debate on sun-dimming research has intensified and widened. In the past, this was an area partly funded by the fossil fuel industry, but in recent years, more actors have become involved, including philanthropists, financiers and hi-tech entrepreneurs, motivated by potential lucrative rewards and growing alarm about climate dangers. More money is flowing into the sector particularly in the United States, where Bill Gates is among supporters of the Harvard solar geoengineering research program, and groups such as the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Environmental Defense Fund, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and the Natural Resources Defense Council have expressed support for further studies into sunlight reflection technologies. The sector sometimes evinces a wild-west, make-up-the-rules-as-you-go-along, profiteering spirit, most evident in the US start-up Make Sunsets, which is already selling \u201ccooling credits\u201d and claiming to have conducted outdoor tests in Mexico.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: phase out fossil fuels, governance of solar geoengineering\npolicy: UNEP report on SRM, de facto moratorium on geoengineering\ntechnology: solar geoengineering, sun-dimming research, sunlight reflection technologies, cooling credits"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710771204,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

{"text":"1 Eat less beef Nobody wants to be told what to eat when food connects us to culture, heritage, family and identity. But the numbers are hard to ignore: beef has a larger climate impact by far than any other commonly eaten food. If you\u2019re not ready to swear off burgers or galbi entirely, start small by swapping one serving of beef each week with one serving of chicken \u2013 you\u2019ll save 0.71 tons of CO2 a year per person. 2 Vote, especially in local elections Individual changes in consumption are not going to be enough to fix our broken food system \u2013 it\u2019ll take policy to do that. Whether you\u2019re most concerned with food waste, subsidies for big ag, or farm worker protections, you\u2019ll want representatives who will fight for your interests when the time comes to shape policy. 3 Switch your stove from gas to electric Gas stoves are terrible for human health and leak planet-warming gases even when not in use. Switching them out isn\u2019t possible for everyone and can be particularly tricky for renters, but regardless of your living situation, it\u2019s worth using Rewiring America\u2019s IRA calculator to see what kinds of rebates might be available to help you make the switch. 4 Host a kitchen gadget swap Did you buy an immersion blender on sale three years ago only to realize you don\u2019t like eating soup?

{"text":"The Conservatives have been accused by human rights experts of hypocrisy after cracking down on climate and Gaza protests while celebrating and endorsing farmers\u2019 protests in Wales. Rishi Sunak joined a protest of farmers in Wales last Friday, after they had obstructed a road while campaigning against the Labour government\u2019s new farming subsidies scheme. But this week he vowed to crack down on protests, referring to them as \u201cmob rule\u201d. On Wednesday, the Welsh Conservative leader, Andrew Davies, along with many of his colleagues greeted and posed for photographs with farmers who formed a large group outside the Senedd and blocked a main road with tractors. Meanwhile, climate protesters were arrested while marching through the City of London to demand insurance companies stop insuring fossil fuel projects. At a climate protest outside the London headquarters of the Axa insurance group on Thursday, police told protesters who stood in the road they would be liable for arrest for interfering with vital national infrastructure, a new offence under the Public Order Act 2023 that allows them to criminalise anyone blocking a road. In recent years, the government has tightened legislation specifically to stop climate protesters from blocking roads, and dozens have been imprisoned as a result. This week, Sunak announced a range of measures to stop protesters from obstructing the homes or workplaces of politicians \u2013 including their parliaments. However, on Wednesday in parliament he offered support to the Welsh farmers who had gathered in their thousands outside the Welsh parliament. Yasmine Ahmed, UK director of Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cThe idea that politicians are celebrating one set of protesters while cracking down on others is

Rishi Sunak joined a protest of farmers in Wales last Friday, after they had obstructed a road while campaigning against the Labour government\u2019s new farming subsidies scheme. But this week he vowed to crack down on protests, referring to them as \u201cmob rule\u201d. On Wednesday, the Welsh Conservative leader, Andrew Davies, along with many of his colleagues greeted and posed for photographs with farmers who formed a large group outside the Senedd and blocked a main road with tractors. Meanwhile, climate protesters were arrested while marching through the City of London to demand insurance companies stop insuring fossil fuel projects. At a climate protest outside the London headquarters of the Axa insurance group on Thursday, police told protesters who stood in the road they would be liable for arrest for interfering with vital national infrastructure, a new offence under the Public Order Act 2023 that allows them to criminalise anyone blocking a road. In recent years, the government has tightened legislation specifically to stop climate protesters from blocking roads, and dozens have been imprisoned as a result. This week, Sunak announced a range of measures to stop protesters from obstructing the homes or workplaces of politicians \u2013 including their parliaments. However, on Wednesday in parliament he offered support to the Welsh farmers who had gathered in their thousands outside the Welsh parliament. Yasmine Ahmed, UK director of Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cThe idea that politicians are celebrating one set of protesters while cracking down on others is chilling.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: cracking down on climate and Gaza protests, celebrating and endorsing farmers\u2019 protests in Wales, campaigning against the Labour government\u2019s new farming subsidies scheme, demanding insurance companies stop insuring fossil fuel projects, tightening legislation specifically to stop climate protesters from blocking roads\npolicy: \ntechnology: fossil fuel projects, insurance companies, vital national infrastructure, Public Order Act 2023"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710771306,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

In Europe, farmers have been blockading major cities including Paris and Brussels to rail against new EU environmental regulations. Last year at the NFU conference, the then environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, rejected calls to regulate the egg supply chain after supermarket shelves emptied and egg farmers were going out of business due to rising costs.

And we\u2019ve got to do both.\u201d Over the weekend, 30 farmers parked their tractors at a supermarket car park in Dover, while 100 Welsh farmers parked up outside a Labour leadership debate to demand the Welsh government stops plans to force them to plant 10% of their land with trees. In Europe, farmers have been blockading major cities including Paris and Brussels to rail against new EU environmental regulations. Last year at the NFU conference, the then environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, rejected calls to regulate the egg supply chain after supermarket shelves emptied and egg farmers were going out of business due to rising costs. She rejected the idea there was a \u201cmarket failure\u201d and then was booed by farmers. In a change of policy, Sunak is expected to announce \u201cplans to ensure all farmers and producers are treated fairly\u201d, with new regulations for the egg sector to ensure they have reasonable and transparent contracts with supermarkets and others in the supply chain expected to come later this year.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: planting trees, force them to plant 10% of their land with trees\npolicy: \ntechnology: environmental regulations"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710771338,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"According to the Transnational Institute, there have been 1,383 known ISDS cases to date. These courts dish out the highest average claims for damages and the highest average awards of any legal system in the world. The panels are composed of three lawyers \u2013 one appointed by the investor, one by the state, and a president agreed by both. They are mostly white, male, business-friendly investment lawyers from the global north. And so far it is mostly investors who have been the system\u2019s beneficiaries, winning 61% of ISDS case decisions between 1987 and 2017, with an average award of $504m each. Fossil fuel magnates won 72% of their cases, shaking down governments for more than $77bn, according to the Transnational Institute. The three panellists often play more than one role within the ISDS system. So-called \u201crevolving door\u201d and \u201cdouble-hatting\u201d practices allow lawyers to work as arbitrators, presidents or experts for both investors and states \u2013 sometimes at the same time. This can create boundary issues when, for example, a lawyer acts as counsel for a fossil fuel investor in one ISDS case and, at the same time or thereabouts, \u201cdouble hats\u201d as the arbitrator (or president) in another ISDS case. Allowing foreign investors to help shape these panels creates \u201cobvious risks of bias, conflicts of interest, potential misconduct and other abuses of power\u201d, warned the UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, David Boyd, in a report in October last

These courts dish out the highest average claims for damages and the highest average awards of any legal system in the world. The panels are composed of three lawyers \u2013 one appointed by the investor, one by the state, and a president agreed by both. They are mostly white, male, business-friendly investment lawyers from the global north. And so far it is mostly investors who have been the system\u2019s beneficiaries, winning 61% of ISDS case decisions between 1987 and 2017, with an average award of $504m each. Fossil fuel magnates won 72% of their cases, shaking down governments for more than $77bn, according to the Transnational Institute. The three panellists often play more than one role within the ISDS system.

Allowing foreign investors to help shape these panels creates \u201cobvious risks of bias, conflicts of interest, potential misconduct and other abuses of power\u201d, warned the UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, David Boyd, in a report in October last year.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: fossil fuel, ISDS (Investor-State Dispute Settlement)"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710771346,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"As many as hundreds of thousands of newly hatched Chinook salmon released into the Klamath River have died due to \u201cgas bubble disease\u201d caused by extreme changes in water pressure. The young salmon fry were released amid the largest dam removal project in US history along the 257-mile-long river, which flows across Oregon and California. Four hydropower dams are being removed, reconnecting the lower and upper portions of the Klamath River for the first time in a century and allowing fish free passage along the river. The removal is the result of a decades-long campaign by tribes, environmentalists and fishers to restore the river and its ecosystem to their natural state. One dam has been fully demolished and three others are scheduled to come down this year. Last week, the California department of fish and wildlife (CDFW) released 830,000 hatchery-raised fall-run Chinook, only to discover days later that they were dying downstream of the 173ft Iron Gate dam, which is scheduled to be demolished soon. A tunnel at the dam\u2019s base had been opened to allow the river to pass freely across it for the first time in a century, a step before the structure could be fully removed. Many of the young fish, which were only 1-2in long, appear to have died passing through that tunnel, because the water pressure inside was too great for them. Officials do not know exactly how many of the fry have died, but expect a \u201cvery high mortality rate\u201d, according to Jordan Traverso, deputy director of communications for the CDFW. Dead fish caught downstream of the tunnel, in a trap that officials use to monitor their health and numbers, showed classic signs of gas bubble disease, including popped eyes, according to the

The young salmon fry were released amid the largest dam removal project in US history along the 257-mile-long river, which flows across Oregon and California. Four hydropower dams are being removed, reconnecting the lower and upper portions of the Klamath River for the first time in a century and allowing fish free passage along the river. The removal is the result of a decades-long campaign by tribes, environmentalists and fishers to restore the river and its ecosystem to their natural state. One dam has been fully demolished and three others are scheduled to come down this year. Last week, the California department of fish and wildlife (CDFW) released 830,000 hatchery-raised fall-run Chinook, only to discover days later that they were dying downstream of the 173ft Iron Gate dam, which is scheduled to be demolished soon. A tunnel at the dam\u2019s base had been opened to allow the river to pass freely across it for the first time in a century, a step before the structure could be fully removed. Many of the young fish, which were only 1-2in long, appear to have died passing through that tunnel, because the water pressure inside was too great for them. Officials do not know exactly how many of the fry have died, but expect a \u201cvery high mortality rate\u201d, according to Jordan Traverso, deputy director of communications for the CDFW. Dead fish caught downstream of the tunnel, in a trap that officials use to monitor their health and numbers, showed classic signs of gas bubble disease, including popped eyes, according to the CDFW.\n'''"],"response":["project: largest dam removal project in US history\ninitiative: restore the river and its ecosystem to their natural state\npolicy: \ntechnology: hydropower dams, hatchery-raised fall-run Chinook, tunnel"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710771384,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"A new activist group, Shut the System, claimed responsibility for the action after its supporters fled the scene, according to a witness. Elsewhere in Europe, there were protests and actions in France, Germany and Switzerland. And in the US, rallies took place in New York City, Houston, San Francisco, Portland and Denver Frontline communities also mobilised, with actions in Uganda and Tanzania, which will be affected by the East African crude oil pipeline (Eacop), as well as Nigeria, Egypt and Kenya in Africa, as well as Bangladesh, the Philippines and Indonesia in south Asia, and Costa Rica, Columbia and Peru in Latin America. Paul Parker, the recording clerk of Quakers in Britain, which joined actions in London, said: \u201cThose who offer financial backing and social legitimacy to new fossil fuel projects now have an urgent moral responsibility to change course. This duty extends to all sectors and all parts of society. \u201cThe insurance industry has significant influence on the global economy; you can put our whole world on a safer trajectory by showing leadership now.\u201d Winterstein added: \u201cThis week has sent an extremely powerful message to the insurance industry that they must introduce exclusion policies on fossil fuels now because later is too late. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the impact already \u2013 Probitas has confirmed to campaigners that they will rule out Eacop and [the recently approved] west Cumbria mine, which is a huge success, and Zurich\u2019s CEO has requested a meeting with campaigners. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that so many different communities and groups from the frontline of the climate crisis have taken action because they realise that the insurance industry is a key strategic lever for change.\u201d","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/01/stop-insuring-fossil-fuel-activists-target-london-insurers-week-action_1","publication_date":"2024-03-01T14:11:34Z"},"_input_hash":-677487286,"_task_hash":-1271711603,"tokens":[{"text":"A","start":0,"end":1,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"new","start":2,"end":5,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"activist","start":6,"end":14,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"group","start":15,"end":20,"id":3,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":20,"end":21,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"Shut","start":22,"end":26,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":27,"end":30,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"System","start":31,"end":37,"id":7,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":37,"end":38,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"claimed","start":39,"end":46,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"responsibility","start":47,"end":61,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":62,"end":65,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":66,"end":69,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"action","start":70,"end":76,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"after","start":77,"end":82,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"its","start":83,"end":86,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"supporters","start":87,"end":97,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"fled","start":98,"end":102,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":103,"end":106,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"scene","start":107,"end":112,"id":19,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":112,"end":113,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"according","start":114,"end":123,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":124,"end":126,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":127,"end":128,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"witness","start":129,"end":136,"id":24,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":136,"end":137,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"Elsewhere","start":138,"end":147,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":148,"end":150,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"Europe","start":151,"end":157,"id":28,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":157,"end":158,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"there","start":159,"end":164,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"were","start":165,"end":169,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"protests","start":170,"end":178,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":179,"end":182,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"actions","start":183,"end":190,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":191,"end":193,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"France","start":194,"end":200,"id":36,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":200,"end":201,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"Germany","start":202,"end":209,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":210,"end":213,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"Switzerland","start":214,"end":225,"id":40,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":225,"end":226,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"And","start":227,"end":230,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":231,"end":233,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":234,"end":237,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"US","start":238,"end":240,"id":45,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":240,"end":241,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"rallies","start":242,"end":249,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"took","start":250,"end":254,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"place","start":255,"end":260,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":261,"end":263,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"New","start":264,"end":267,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"York","start":268,"end":272,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"City","start":273,"end":277,"id":53,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":277,"end":278,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"Houston","start":279,"end":286,"id":55,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":286,"end":287,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"San","start":288,"end":291,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"Francisco","start":292,"end":301,"id":58,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":301,"end":302,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"Portland","start":303,"end":311,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":312,"end":315,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"Denver","start":316,"end":322,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"Frontline","start":323,"end":332,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"communities","start":333,"end":344,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"also","start":345,"end":349,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"mobilised","start":350,"end":359,"id":66,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":359,"end":360,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":361,"end":365,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"actions","start":366,"end":373,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":374,"end":376,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"Uganda","start":377,"end":383,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":384,"end":387,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"Tanzania","start":388,"end":396,"id":73,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":396,"end":397,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"which","start":398,"end":403,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"will","start":404,"end":408,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":409,"end":411,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"affected","start":412,"end":420,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":421,"end":423,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":424,"end":427,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"East","start":428,"end":432,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"African","start":433,"end":440,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"crude","start":441,"end":446,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"oil","start":447,"end":450,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":

{"text":"Tony Wood, director of Grattan\u2019s energy and climate change program, said this put emissions reductions at risk via a \u201cperverse incentive\u201d, given the surge in SUV ownership in Australia. SUVs fall under the light commercial vehicle category, and critics claim the huge uptake of the more polluting larger cars has occurred in part due to tax perks incentivising the vehicles for families and small businesses that don\u2019t require its size. \u201cIn the US, for example, although targets within each segment have consistently been met, the effectiveness of the scheme has been undermined because people have continued to abandon passenger vehicles in favour of SUVs and light trucks,\u201d Grattan\u2019s submission said. \u201cAcross its entire fleet, the US recorded an increase in average vehicle emissions from new car sales in 2019, compared to 2018 \u2013 despite most manufacturers meeting their targets,\u201d Grattan said. Toyota, Australia\u2019s most popular vehicle brand, said last week that the proposed fuel efficiency standard was \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201ctoo quick\u201d for manufacturers.

There have been many exciting changes at Knepp since 2018, when Isabella Tree wrote Wilding, her award-winning book about rewilding an unprofitable 3,500-acre arable and dairy farm. Now she has written a captivating illustrated book, Wilding: How to Bring Wildlife Back \u2013 An Illustrated Guide, updating her readers about extraordinary developments at Knepp and offering practical advice about rewilding their own spaces, however small. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a world of eco-anxiety and most of us, I guess, stick our heads in the sand because these problems are so enormous,\u201d says Tree. \u201cHow is one individual going to make a difference to climate meltdown and biodiversity? \u2018It\u2019s impossible,\u2019 you think.

{"text":"\u201cThere have been some indications of it [fungi abundance at this level] before, so this is another piece of the puzzle.\u201d Another critical discovery made during the cataloguing process, said Carlos Duarte, a marine science professor and senior author of the study, was the role viruses played in boosting gene diversity. \u201cThe viruses insert themselves and move genes from one organism to another. That means viruses create genomic biodiversity and that accelerates their evolution.\u201d One result of that acceleration, he said, were genes that had evolved to enable organisms to chew through plastic. \u201cThey can degrade synthetic polymers, derived from hydrocarbons, which are very recent as a pollutant in the ocean, showing that evolution happened in a few decades.\u201d The catalogue also highlighted gaps in our understanding of the ocean floor, said Laiolo. \u201cIt is easier to sample the water than the ocean floor and what we underline in the paper is the need to increase studies targeting the seabed in the future.\u201d Developments in supercomputing and sequencing technologies, she said, means more information can be gleaned from existing samples, at much lower

{"text":"\u201cThese lorikeets \u2013 each one has its own personality. They\u2019re smart and beautiful and to have to kill bird after bird is terrible,\u201d he says. Robyn Gray remembers one afternoon \u2013 \u201cthe worst day\u201d \u2013 when she had about 200 lorikeets arrive in boxes and cages that were scattered around her house. Gray is a retired office clerk and a licensed volunteer carer for Wires and lives near Grafton. Her spare bedroom was turned into a makeshift triage ward. \u201cIf they couldn\u2019t walk or swallow, we thought they were suffering and they needed to be euthanised. The poor birds were in a lot of pain,\u201d she says. But Gray now has about 350 lorikeets recovering from LPS in two aviaries in her back yard. Some are getting ready to be released, as are about 50 of the birds with the RSPCA in Brisbane. \u201cOnce it\u2019s all over I\u2019ll revisit everything and I will probably crumble after that,\u201d

{"text":"They did not do this. Another hot topic on the agenda at the dinner were the \u201cevents at Thames Water\u201d. The beleaguered company has faced financial woes and auditors have warned that without a cash injection it could go under by April. Last year, it emerged that contingency plans for its collapse were being drawn up by the UK government, amid fears that Britain\u2019s biggest water company would not survive because of its huge debt pile. Other water companies are thought to be facing similar, though less severe, financial pressures. Severn Trent, Northumbrian Water, Southern Water and South West Water declined to comment on the record. An Ofwat spokesperson said: \u201cOfwat remains focused on holding water companies to account on behalf of customers and has imposed fines and performance penalties worth \u00a3250m in the past few years. At this meeting we made clear to the chairs of water companies our dissatisfaction on progress in reducing pollution, the use of storm overflows, and concerns about the impact of proposed bill rises on customers, especially the most vulnerable.\u201d An Environment Agency spokesperson said: \u201cIt is not unusual for the Environment Agency chair to meet his counterparts at water companies. These are working meetings used to challenge companies on their performance and drive forward improvements that we, as a regulator, expect to

{"text":"What\u2019s happening in Alabama is an example of how special interests have taken advantage of the diminishing reach and influence of shrinking mainstream newsrooms in the US. In their place have sprung up fake \u201cpink slime\u201d news sites operated by political interests; a utility that secretly created news outlets to attack its critics; and a Florida publisher who accepts payments for positive coverage. This investigation into power companies infiltrating local media follows Floodlight\u2019s revelation earlier this month about how utilities wield influence among civil rights groups. In the last decade, nearly a dozen local reporters and editors were hired to staff the two Alabama news outlets. A Floodlight review of the content since the utility founded the Alabama News Center in 2015 shows it publishes overwhelmingly positive stories about the power company. Coverage of the utility by the Birmingham Times, which was funded with money from Alabama Power\u2019s charitable arm the Alabama Power Foundation, consists of reprinted stories from the News Center and the utility\u2019s own press releases. The Birmingham Times executive editor, Barnett Wright, said the outlet\u2019s coverage is limited due to its small staff and having to make hard editorial decisions on what to cover. \u201cThe Alabama Power Foundation had or has zero influence in the newsroom,\u201d Wright said in an email. \u201cAs the executive editor, I have never had any conversation with the Alabama Power Foundation about any article the Birmingham Times chooses to run or not run.\u201d Alabama Power and its foundation did not respond to multiple requests for comment.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/17/alabama-power-electric-utility-finance-birmingham-news_1","publication_date":"2024-01-17T11:00:27Z"},"_input_hash":-1779980935,"_task_hash":-427653845,"tokens":[{"text":"What","start":0,"end":4,"id":0,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":4,"end":6,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"happening","start":7,"end":16,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":17,"end":19,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"Alabama","start":20,"end":27,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":28,"end":30,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"an","start":31,"end":33,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"example","start":34,"end":41,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":42,"end":44,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"how","start":45,"end":48,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"special","start":49,"end":56,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"interests","start":57,"end":66,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"have","start":67,"end":71,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"taken","start":72,"end":77,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"advantage","start":78,"end":87,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":88,"end":90,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":91,"end":94,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"diminishing","start":95,"end":106,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"reach","start":107,"end":112,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":113,"end":116,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"influence","start":117,"end":126,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":127,"end":129,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"shrinking","start":130,"end":139,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"mainstream","start":140,"end":150,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"newsrooms","start":151,"end":160,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":161,"end":163,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":164,"end":167,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"US","start":168,"end":170,"id":27,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":170,"end":171,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"In","start":172,"end":174,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"their","start":175,"end":180,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"place","start":181,"end":186,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"have","start":187,"end":191,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"sprung","start":192,"end":198,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"up","start":199,"end":201,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"fake","start":202,"end":206,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"\u201c","start":207,"end":208,"id":36,"ws":false},{"text":"pink","start":208,"end":212,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"slime","start":213,"end":218,"id":38,"ws":false},{"text":"\u201d","start":218,"end":219,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"news","start":220,"end":224,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"sites","start":225,"end":230,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"operated","start":231,"end":239,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":240,"end":242,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"political","start":243,"end":252,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"interests","start":253,"end":262,"id":45,"ws":false},{"text":";","start":262,"end":263,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":264,"end":265,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"utility","start":266,"end":273,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":274,"end":278,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"secretly","start":279,"end":287,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"created","start":288,"end":295,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"news","start":296,"end":300,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"outlets","start":301,"end":308,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":309,"end":311,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"attack","start":312,"end":318,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"its","start":319,"end":322,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"critics","start":323,"end":330,"id":57,"ws":false},{"text":";","start":330,"end":331,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":332,"end":335,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":336,"end":337,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"Florida","start":338,"end":345,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"publisher","start":346,"end":355,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"who","start":356,"end":359,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"accepts","start":360,"end":367,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"payments","start":368,"end":376,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":377,"end":380,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"positive","start":381,"end":389,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"coverage","start":390,"end":398,"id":68,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":398,"end":399,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"This","start":400,"end":404,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"investigation","start":405,"end":418,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"into","start":419,"end":423,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"power","start":424,"end":429,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"companies","start":430,"end":439,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"infiltrating","start":440,"end":452,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"local","start":453,"end":458,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"media","start":459,"end":464,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"follows","start":465,"end":472,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"Floodlight","start":473,"end":483,"id":79,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":483,"end":485,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"revelation","start":486,"end":496,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"earlier","start":497,"end":504,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"this","start":505,"end":509,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"mo

In their place have sprung up fake \u201cpink slime\u201d news sites operated by political interests; a utility that secretly created news outlets to attack its critics; and a Florida publisher who accepts payments for positive coverage. This investigation into power companies infiltrating local media follows Floodlight\u2019s revelation earlier this month about how utilities wield influence among civil rights groups. In the last decade, nearly a dozen local reporters and editors were hired to staff the two Alabama news outlets. A Floodlight review of the content since the utility founded the Alabama News Center in 2015 shows it publishes overwhelmingly positive stories about the power company. Coverage of the utility by the Birmingham Times, which was funded with money from Alabama Power\u2019s charitable arm the Alabama Power Foundation, consists of reprinted stories from the News Center and the utility\u2019s own press releases. The Birmingham Times executive editor, Barnett Wright, said the outlet\u2019s coverage is limited due to its small staff and having to make hard editorial decisions on what to cover. \u201cThe Alabama Power Foundation had or has zero influence in the newsroom,\u201d Wright said in an email. \u201cAs the executive editor, I have never had any conversation with the Alabama Power Foundation about any article the Birmingham Times chooses to run or not run.\u201d Alabama Power and its foundation did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n'''"],"response":["project: Alabama News Center\ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: fake \u201cpink slime\u201d news sites, microorganisms, solar panels, electric vehicles"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710771758,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

{"text":"Beneath the Cadson Bury hillfort, the River Lynher rushes past a tangle of fallen trees, boggy pools, rivulets, and debris cast up into overhanging branches. Beside flowering gorse bushes, steep rabbit-grazed turf leads up to even steeper ramparts edging the fort. From these prehistoric defences, all-round views take in the woodland on the other side of the river \u2013 a purplish, brown and grey canopy of budding alder and lichen-encrusted oak twigs, stretching downstream past Newton Ferrers, and towards the medieval clapper bridge at Pillaton. To the west, Caradon Hill and Sharp Tor mark the skyline of Bodmin Moor, rising above upper reaches of the Lynher. There, near Stara bridge, is a favourite place, dating from childhood when my younger sister and I stayed with our paternal grandparents. At the hamlet of Darley, close to Notter Tor with its overgrown quarries and mine shafts, overlooked by the shadowy profile of Cheesewring quarry, my grandfather cultivated a garden with fruit and vegetables, milked two South Devon cows, kept hens and rotated a few bullocks in little stony pastures. Occasionally he rode towards the moor on his chestnut mare, Gaiety. Until a borehole was divined and installed, the house was plumbed with rainwater collected from the roof; we helped carry pitchers and covered buckets of drinking water pumped from a nearby well. Familiar narrow lanes, edged in granite hedge banks clothed in dripping mosses, pennywort and ferns, wind downhill. Before the onset of this recent dry spell, these ways ran as streams, channelling excessive run-off and detritus from enlarged and waterlogged fields towards the river, unusually high and swollen with

Beside flowering gorse bushes, steep rabbit-grazed turf leads up to even steeper ramparts edging the fort. From these prehistoric defences, all-round views take in the woodland on the other side of the river \u2013 a purplish, brown and grey canopy of budding alder and lichen-encrusted oak twigs, stretching downstream past Newton Ferrers, and towards the medieval clapper bridge at Pillaton. To the west, Caradon Hill and Sharp Tor mark the skyline of Bodmin Moor, rising above upper reaches of the Lynher. There, near Stara bridge, is a favourite place, dating from childhood when my younger sister and I stayed with our paternal grandparents. At the hamlet of Darley, close to Notter Tor with its overgrown quarries and mine shafts, overlooked by the shadowy profile of Cheesewring quarry, my grandfather cultivated a garden with fruit and vegetables, milked two South Devon cows, kept hens and rotated a few bullocks in little stony pastures. Occasionally he rode towards the moor on his chestnut mare, Gaiety. Until a borehole was divined and installed, the house was plumbed with rainwater collected from the roof; we helped carry pitchers and covered buckets of drinking water pumped from a nearby well. Familiar narrow lanes, edged in granite hedge banks clothed in dripping mosses, pennywort and ferns, wind downhill. Before the onset of this recent dry spell, these ways ran as streams, channelling excessive run-off and detritus from enlarged and waterlogged fields towards the river, unusually high and swollen with water from the eastern side of the moor.\n'''"],"response":["project: Cadson Bury hillfort\ninitiative: cultivating a garden with fruit and vegetables, keeping hens, rotating bullocks in little stony pastures\npolicy: \ntechnology: rainwater collection system, borehole"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710771773,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

Now experts say they have discovered that showers with a higher pressure are associated with a lower consumption of water, while a timer in the shower could also help. \u201cWhile the adoption of low-flow equipment might be a valuable strategy for enhancing shower efficiency and moving towards net zero, it should not be the sole focus,\u201d the researchers report. The research, which is available as a preprint but has not yet been peer-reviewed, involved the team installing sensors in 290 showers around the University of Surrey campus. In total, they gathered data on the duration of 86,000 individual showers. The researchers found that while some showers were very long, the average duration was 6.7 minutes. Half of the showers took between 3.3 and 8.8 minutes. \u201cWe excluded any showers over one hour, but believe me, they happened,\u201d Ian Walker, a co-author and professor of environmental psychology at the University of Swansea, noted in a post on X. By combining the duration of each showering event with the shower\u2019s flow rate, the team were able to calculate the amount of water involved in each use. The results reveal that at any given flow rate, higher-pressure showers were associated with lower water consumption.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/10/high-shower-pressure-can-help-people-save-water-study-suggests_0","publication_date":"2024-03-10T14:33:09Z"},"_input_hash":-1348247305,"_task_hash":182546806,"tokens":[{"text":"Swapping","start":0,"end":8,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":9,"end":10,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"feeble","start":11,"end":17,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"dribble","start":18,"end":25,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":26,"end":29,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":30,"end":31,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"powerful","start":32,"end":40,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"blast","start":41,"end":46,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"might","start":47,"end":52,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"seem","start":53,"end":57,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"like","start":58,"end":62,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"an","start":63,"end":65,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"environmental","start":66,"end":79,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"indulgence","start":80,"end":90,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"when","start":91,"end":95,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":96,"end":98,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"comes","start":99,"end":104,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":105,"end":107,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"taking","start":108,"end":114,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":115,"end":116,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"shower","start":117,"end":123,"id":20,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":123,"end":124,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"but","start":125,"end":128,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"researchers","start":129,"end":140,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"say","start":141,"end":144,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":145,"end":147,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"might","start":148,"end":153,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"actually","start":154,"end":162,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"save","start":163,"end":167,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"water","start":168,"end":173,"id":29,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":173,"end":174,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"Water","start":175,"end":180,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"consumption","start":181,"end":192,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"has","start":193,"end":196,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"become","start":197,"end":203,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":204,"end":205,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"key","start":206,"end":209,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"area","start":210,"end":214,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":215,"end":217,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"environmental","start":218,"end":231,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"concern","start":232,"end":239,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"given","start":240,"end":245,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"shortages","start":246,"end":255,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":256,"end":258,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":259,"end":262,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"resource","start":263,"end":271,"id":45,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":271,"end":272,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":273,"end":275,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"well","start":276,"end":280,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":281,"end":283,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":284,"end":287,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"carbon","start":288,"end":294,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"footprint","start":295,"end":304,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"associated","start":305,"end":315,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":316,"end":320,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"its","start":321,"end":324,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"collection","start":325,"end":335,"id":56,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":335,"end":336,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"treatment","start":337,"end":346,"id":58,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":346,"end":347,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"supply","start":348,"end":354,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":355,"end":358,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"\u2013","start":359,"end":360,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":361,"end":363,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":364,"end":367,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"case","start":368,"end":372,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":373,"end":375,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"most","start":376,"end":380,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"showers","start":381,"end":388,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"\u2013","start":389,"end":390,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"heating","start":391,"end":398,"id":70,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":398,"end":399,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"Now","start":400,"end":403,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"experts","start":404,"end":411,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"say","start":412,"end":415,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"they","start":416,"end":420,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"have","start":421,"end":425,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"discovered","start":426,"end":436,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":437,"end":441,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"showers","start":442,"end":449,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":450,"end":454,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":455,"end":456,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"higher","start":457,"end":463,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"pressure","start":464,"end":472,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":473,"end":476,"id":84,"ws

The research, which is available as a preprint but has not yet been peer-reviewed, involved the team installing sensors in 290 showers around the University of Surrey campus. In total, they gathered data on the duration of 86,000 individual showers. The researchers found that while some showers were very long, the average duration was 6.7 minutes. Half of the showers took between 3.3 and 8.8 minutes. \u201cWe excluded any showers over one hour, but believe me, they happened,\u201d Ian Walker, a co-author and professor of environmental psychology at the University of Swansea, noted in a post on X. By combining the duration of each showering event with the shower\u2019s flow rate, the team were able to calculate the amount of water involved in each use. The results reveal that at any given flow rate, higher-pressure showers were associated with lower water consumption.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: enhancing shower efficiency, moving towards net zero\npolicy: \ntechnology: low-flow equipment, sensors, timer"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710771800,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

However, Atkins \u2013 who is now health secretary \u2013 did not respond when asked whether she was still opposed to the proposals. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero declined to comment on the case, instead issuing a general statement defending the UK\u2019s decision to \u201cmax out\u201d oil and gas in the midst of a climate crisis.\n'''"],"response":["project: new oil well\ninitiative: investing in the old economy, investing in the new economy, generating jobs, generating GDP growth\npolicy: \ntechnology: oil and gas"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710771809,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"Najin and her daughter Fatu, the world\u2019s last two living northern white rhinos, inhabit an evolutionary twilight zone: the last living proof of a lineage that stretches back millions of years but is functionally extinct. But this week, scientists came a step closer to bringing the species back from the brink of oblivion by performing the first successful embryo transfer in a related white rhino species. The ultimate goal of restoring an entire herd of northern white rhinos using a bank of frozen eggs, sperm and embryos and gene-editing technologies may sound like a case of technological hubris \u2013 of scientists attempting to play god. But the team behind the project, and others, say that IVF and other assisted reproductive technologies (ART) could transform conservation efforts in some species and buffer against the devastating effects of climate breakdown and habitat loss. \u201cScientists can offer to rewind some of these dramatic mistakes made by humans,\u201d said Prof Thomas Hildebrandt, of the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin and head of the rhino BioRescue project. \u201cWe don\u2019t play god. We try to preserve what god has created. We only bring back what was on this planet and was destroyed by people.\u201d Hildebrandt views the technology as a last-ditch insurance policy for \u201ccornerstone\u201d species, such as the northern white rhino, whose loss would lead to a cascade of knock-on effects for entire ecosystems. But in many species, efforts are under way long before species reach such terminal levels of decline.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/27/rewinding-human-mistakes-can-ivf-save-the-worlds-most-threatened-species_0","publication_date":"2024-01-27T07:00:29Z"},"_input_hash":40045488,"_task_hash":-1426242494,"tokens":[{"text":"Najin","start":0,"end":5,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":6,"end":9,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"her","start":10,"end":13,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"daughter","start":14,"end":22,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"Fatu","start":23,"end":27,"id":4,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":27,"end":28,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":29,"end":32,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"world","start":33,"end":38,"id":7,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":38,"end":40,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"last","start":41,"end":45,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"two","start":46,"end":49,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"living","start":50,"end":56,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"northern","start":57,"end":65,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"white","start":66,"end":71,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"rhinos","start":72,"end":78,"id":14,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":78,"end":79,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"inhabit","start":80,"end":87,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"an","start":88,"end":90,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"evolutionary","start":91,"end":103,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"twilight","start":104,"end":112,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"zone","start":113,"end":117,"id":20,"ws":false},{"text":":","start":117,"end":118,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":119,"end":122,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"last","start":123,"end":127,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"living","start":128,"end":134,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"proof","start":135,"end":140,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":141,"end":143,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":144,"end":145,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"lineage","start":146,"end":153,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":154,"end":158,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"stretches","start":159,"end":168,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"back","start":169,"end":173,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"millions","start":174,"end":182,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":183,"end":185,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"years","start":186,"end":191,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"but","start":192,"end":195,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":196,"end":198,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"functionally","start":199,"end":211,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"extinct","start":212,"end":219,"id":38,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":219,"end":220,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"But","start":221,"end":224,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"this","start":225,"end":229,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"week","start":230,"end":234,"id":42,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":234,"end":235,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"scientists","start":236,"end":246,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"came","start":247,"end":251,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":252,"end":253,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"step","start":254,"end":258,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"closer","start":259,"end":265,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":266,"end":268,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"bringing","start":269,"end":277,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":278,"end":281,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"species","start":282,"end":289,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"back","start":290,"end":294,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"from","start":295,"end":299,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":300,"end":303,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"brink","start":304,"end":309,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":310,"end":312,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"oblivion","start":313,"end":321,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":322,"end":324,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"performing","start":325,"end":335,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":336,"end":339,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"first","start":340,"end":345,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"successful","start":346,"end":356,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"embryo","start":357,"end":363,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"transfer","start":364,"end":372,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":373,"end":375,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":376,"end":377,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"related","start":378,"end":385,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"white","start":386,"end":391,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"rhino","start":392,"end":397,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"species","start":398,"end":405,"id":71,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":405,"end":406,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"The","start":407,"end":410,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"ultimate","start":411,"end":419,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"goal","start":420,"end":424,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":425,"end":427,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"restoring","start":428,"end":437,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"an","start":438,"end":440,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"entire","start":441,"end":447,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"herd","start":448,"end":452,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":453,"end":455,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"northern","start":456,"end":464,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"white","start":465,"end":470,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"rhinos","start":471,"end":477,"id":84,"ws":

{"text":"The lawsuit is the latest in a wave of climate litigation in the Netherlands and around the world. In 2019, the Dutch government lost the landmark Urgenda case when the country\u2019s supreme court found it had explicit duties to protect its citizens\u2019 human rights in the face of the climate emergency and was required to undertake at least its fair share in cutting global emissions. This latest case seeks to build on that ruling and show that the country has legal responsibilities to all of its territories.

{"text":"\u201cI\u2019ve worked on giant pandas, great apes, elephants,\u201d said Hildebrandt. Previously his team has coordinated the collection of semen from wild elephants to improve genetic diversity in zoo populations. The practical challenges can be substantial: elephants need to be immobilised using a helicopter and sperm extracted using electroejaculation. With rhinos, the collection of ovaries and embryo transfer is performed via the rectum, because the ovaries are almost 2 metres deep inside the abdomen. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with an animal that is 2.2 tonnes,\u201d said Hildebrandt. Adapting IVF protocols that were developed for commercial livestock is not always straightforward, according to Dr Andr\u00e9s Gambini, of the University of Queensland, who is developing IVF techniques for the endangered Somali wild ass \u2013 a donkey species \u2013 and koalas. \u201cWe thought the horse is very similar to the donkey, but we did the same thing and it didn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a different biology.\u201d The work is still in progress, but he can help preserve the genes of populations alive today. \u201cWe might not transfer the embryos tomorrow or use those samples today but we know we can use them in the future,\u201d he said.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/27/rewinding-human-mistakes-can-ivf-save-the-worlds-most-threatened-species_1","publication_date":"2024-01-27T07:00:29Z"},"_input_hash":-900631337,"_task_hash":1335501562,"tokens":[{"text":"\u201c","start":0,"end":1,"id":0,"ws":false},{"text":"I","start":1,"end":2,"id":1,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019ve","start":2,"end":5,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"worked","start":6,"end":12,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":13,"end":15,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"giant","start":16,"end":21,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"pandas","start":22,"end":28,"id":6,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":28,"end":29,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"great","start":30,"end":35,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"apes","start":36,"end":40,"id":9,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":40,"end":41,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"elephants","start":42,"end":51,"id":11,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":51,"end":52,"id":12,"ws":false},{"text":"\u201d","start":52,"end":53,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"said","start":54,"end":58,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"Hildebrandt","start":59,"end":70,"id":15,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":70,"end":71,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"Previously","start":72,"end":82,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"his","start":83,"end":86,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"team","start":87,"end":91,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"has","start":92,"end":95,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"coordinated","start":96,"end":107,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":108,"end":111,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"collection","start":112,"end":122,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":123,"end":125,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"semen","start":126,"end":131,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"from","start":132,"end":136,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"wild","start":137,"end":141,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"elephants","start":142,"end":151,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":152,"end":154,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"improve","start":155,"end":162,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"genetic","start":163,"end":170,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"diversity","start":171,"end":180,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":181,"end":183,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"zoo","start":184,"end":187,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"populations","start":188,"end":199,"id":35,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":199,"end":200,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"The","start":201,"end":204,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"practical","start":205,"end":214,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"challenges","start":215,"end":225,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"can","start":226,"end":229,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":230,"end":232,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"substantial","start":233,"end":244,"id":42,"ws":false},{"text":":","start":244,"end":245,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"elephants","start":246,"end":255,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"need","start":256,"end":260,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":261,"end":263,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":264,"end":266,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"immobilised","start":267,"end":278,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"using","start":279,"end":284,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":285,"end":286,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"helicopter","start":287,"end":297,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":298,"end":301,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"sperm","start":302,"end":307,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"extracted","start":308,"end":317,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"using","start":318,"end":323,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"electroejaculation","start":324,"end":342,"id":56,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":342,"end":343,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"With","start":344,"end":348,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"rhinos","start":349,"end":355,"id":59,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":355,"end":356,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":357,"end":360,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"collection","start":361,"end":371,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":372,"end":374,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"ovaries","start":375,"end":382,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":383,"end":386,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"embryo","start":387,"end":393,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"transfer","start":394,"end":402,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":403,"end":405,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"performed","start":406,"end":415,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"via","start":416,"end":419,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":420,"end":423,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"rectum","start":424,"end":430,"id":72,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":430,"end":431,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"because","start":432,"end":439,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":440,"end":443,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"ovaries","start":444,"end":451,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":452,"end":455,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"almost","start":456,"end":462,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"2","start":463,"end":464,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"metres","start":465,"end":471,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"deep","start":472,"end":476,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"inside","start":477,"end":483,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":484,"end":487,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"abdomen","start":

{"text":"The acceleration has alarmed scientists, who fear it is the biggest threat to keeping below 1.5C of global heating and could trigger catastrophic climate tipping points. The rapid rise appears to be due to global heating driving more methane production in wetlands \u2013 a potential vicious circle that makes cuts of human-caused methane emissions even more urgent. Decomposing waste is responsible for about 20% of human-caused methane emissions. Fossil fuel operations cause 40% of emissions, and the Guardian revealed there were more than 1,000 super-emitter events from oil, gas and coal sites in 2022 alone, many of which could be easily fixed. Cattle and paddy fields cause the other 40% of emissions. Prof Euan Nisbet, a methane expert at Royal Holloway University of London, said: \u201cBig landfills make a great deal of methane but it doesn\u2019t cost much to bulldoze soil over a stinking, burning landfill. It\u2019s not rocket science.\u201d Microbes in the soil convert methane into CO2. \u201cThen it\u2019s lost 97% of its greenhouse impact,\u201d Nisbet said. Carlos Silva Filho, president of the International Solid Waste Association, said the global methane pledge made by 150 countries to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030 could not be achieved without

The rapid rise appears to be due to global heating driving more methane production in wetlands \u2013 a potential vicious circle that makes cuts of human-caused methane emissions even more urgent. Decomposing waste is responsible for about 20% of human-caused methane emissions. Fossil fuel operations cause 40% of emissions, and the Guardian revealed there were more than 1,000 super-emitter events from oil, gas and coal sites in 2022 alone, many of which could be easily fixed. Cattle and paddy fields cause the other 40% of emissions. Prof Euan Nisbet, a methane expert at Royal Holloway University of London, said: \u201cBig landfills make a great deal of methane but it doesn\u2019t cost much to bulldoze soil over a stinking, burning landfill.

{"text":"Evidence has recently been presented that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc) may be rapidly weakening, over decades rather than centuries, under the impact of heating oceans and melting ice, and its shutdown could be catastrophic for Europe and other regions. Spinrad said: \u201cWe should be concerned enough to keep an eye on what the science is telling us. Amoc is not going to shut down tomorrow. But systems like Amoc are inherently noisy. By that I mean, don\u2019t just look at how it\u2019s changed from 2023 to 2024. We need to observe these systems over a long period of time. \u201cAs an oceanographer, I\u2019m concerned enough to say this should be a priority for sustained observations. And I think it\u2019s in the next three to five years we should be getting the best idea of whether we\u2019re seeing a real trend.\u201d Spinrad defended NOAA against the threat, raised by some in the US Congress, of rescinding some of the $6bn (\u00a34.7bn) the agency is receiving under Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act.

{"text":"Delve into the passenger car and SUV figures, though, and there is a healthier EV story bubbling away. The Tesla Model 3 is the top-selling sedan in the country, for example, easily outselling the once-dominant Toyota Camry that is tens of thousands of dollars cheaper. The circa-$65,000 sedan has single-handedly breathed life into the medium four-door market in Australia that many brands have abandoned. Add in the rival Polestar 2 and Hyundai Ioniq 6 and electric cars accounted for 62% of all medium cars priced above $60,000, shading former market leaders from Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi. Include mainstream models such as the Camry and EVs are approaching half the medium segment, at 42%. The middle ground It is a similar story with mid-sized SUVs, where the Tesla Model Y dominated 20-odd rivals by commanding a 44% slice of the $60,000-plus SUV segment. It also almost beat the popular Toyota RAV4 in a race to become the top selling SUV.

The Tesla Model 3 is the top-selling sedan in the country, for example, easily outselling the once-dominant Toyota Camry that is tens of thousands of dollars cheaper. The circa-$65,000 sedan has single-handedly breathed life into the medium four-door market in Australia that many brands have abandoned. Add in the rival Polestar 2 and Hyundai Ioniq 6 and electric cars accounted for 62% of all medium cars priced above $60,000, shading former market leaders from Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi. Include mainstream models such as the Camry and EVs are approaching half the medium segment, at 42%. The middle ground It is a similar story with mid-sized SUVs, where the Tesla Model Y dominated 20-odd rivals by commanding a 44% slice of the $60,000-plus SUV segment. It also almost beat the popular Toyota RAV4 in a race to become the top selling SUV. As it stood almost one in six of the 268,480 medium SUVs bought in Australia throughout 2023 were powered only by electrons. And there\u2019s more to come in 2024. Within weeks Subaru and Toyota will start selling electric-only SUVs \u2013 the first battery electric vehicle for each brand in Australia \u2013 although high prices are likely to keep sales modest.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: Tesla Model 3, Toyota Camry, Polestar 2, Hyundai Ioniq 6, Tesla Model Y, Toyota RAV4, Subaru, Toyota, electric vehicles, SUVs, EVs, battery electric vehicle"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710771912,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

{"text":"\u201cForever chemicals\u201d are in our drinking water sources, sea foam and spray, rain and groundwater, sea ice, and even human blood \u2013 so now efforts are increasing to detect, remove and destroy them. With increasing evidence linking per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with cancers, birth defects and negative effects on the immune systems of humans and animals, pressure is growing to restrict these handy waterproofing chemicals that are in everything from Teflon pans and medical devices to cosmetics and pizza boxes. According to Nijhuis Saur industries, which has built more than 80 technologies to treat forever chemicals such as the banned or restricted PFOS, PFOA and PFHxS, these PFAS are difficult and expensive to remove and destroy. \u201cThey are called the forever chemicals, because they cannot be removed easily, they don\u2019t break down very easily, so they will persist forever,\u201d said Wilbert Menkveld, chief technology officer, at the Aquatech Amsterdam conference. \u201cAnd we are talking about very small concentrations: one nanogram per litre is like one glass of cola in a million tankers.\u201d Even when they have been banned, it is hard to get rid of their lingering traces: water cleanups must deal with different concentrations of pollutants and national limits. In the UK, there is a guideline of 100 nanograms per litre for individual PFAS in drinking water, while in EU countries such as the Netherlands, the public health institute RIVM advises a maximum of 4.4ng/l. Similar limits have been proposed for six of the chemicals this year by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in a \u201ctoxicity index\u201d. While the EU is working on a broader ban on the chemicals, many are already in the environment. There were no limits for wastewater, said Menkveld. Dr David Megson, a senior lecturer in chemistry and environmental forensics at Manchester Metropolitan University, said some pollutants were not even being tested for, there was no standard testing protocol for many compounds, and legislation was

With increasing evidence linking per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with cancers, birth defects and negative effects on the immune systems of humans and animals, pressure is growing to restrict these handy waterproofing chemicals that are in everything from Teflon pans and medical devices to cosmetics and pizza boxes. According to Nijhuis Saur industries, which has built more than 80 technologies to treat forever chemicals such as the banned or restricted PFOS, PFOA and PFHxS, these PFAS are difficult and expensive to remove and destroy. \u201cThey are called the forever chemicals, because they cannot be removed easily, they don\u2019t break down very easily, so they will persist forever,\u201d said Wilbert Menkveld, chief technology officer, at the Aquatech Amsterdam conference. \u201cAnd we are talking about very small concentrations: one nanogram per litre is like one glass of cola in a million tankers.\u201d Even when they have been banned, it is hard to get rid of their lingering traces: water cleanups must deal with different concentrations of pollutants and national limits. In the UK, there is a guideline of 100 nanograms per litre for individual PFAS in drinking water, while in EU countries such as the Netherlands, the public health institute RIVM advises a maximum of 4.4ng/l. Similar limits have been proposed for six of the chemicals this year by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in a \u201ctoxicity index\u201d. While the EU is working on a broader ban on the chemicals, many are already in the environment. There were no limits for wastewater, said Menkveld. Dr David Megson, a senior lecturer in chemistry and environmental forensics at Manchester Metropolitan University, said some pollutants were not even being tested for, there was no standard testing protocol for many compounds, and legislation was lagging.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: detect, remove and destroy forever chemicals\npolicy: \ntechnology: Teflon pans, medical devices, cosmetics, PFAS, PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1710771928,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

But they also produce 940bn pounds of manure annually \u2013 twice as much sewage as produced by the human population. The people who live in the shadow of these industrial operations say their health and quality of life are increasingly at risk. Broberg\u2019s experience of water contamination is common in this part of Minnesota, where more than 90,000 people rely on private wells as their primary source for drinking water. In some townships, over 40% of wells exceeded the federal health standard for nitrate \u2013 most of which is caused by animal agriculture. Broberg\u2019s own farm is just down the street from a hog farm that has rapidly expanded over time, so that it now has more than 3,000 animals. According to the Minnesota pollution control agency, nearly 70% of the state\u2019s water pollution comes from crop and livestock production. In Broberg\u2019s region of the state, pollution control officers estimate that 89% of water contamination comes from commercial fertilizer and manure that\u2019s been spread on cropland. Unlike municipal water systems, which are tested regularly, private well owners are entirely responsible for the quality of their water. Various regulations and initiatives have been implemented over the years to address the issue, but as industrial agriculture continues to grow, many residents are demanding more urgent

But they also produce 940bn pounds of manure annually \u2013 twice as much sewage as produced by the human population. The people who live in the shadow of these industrial operations say their health and quality of life are increasingly at risk. Broberg\u2019s experience of water contamination is common in this part of Minnesota, where more than 90,000 people rely on private wells as their primary source for drinking water. In some townships, over 40% of wells exceeded the federal health standard for nitrate \u2013 most of which is caused by animal agriculture. Broberg\u2019s own farm is just down the street from a hog farm that has rapidly expanded over time, so that it now has more than 3,000 animals. According to the Minnesota pollution control agency, nearly 70% of the state\u2019s water pollution comes from crop and livestock production. In Broberg\u2019s region of the state, pollution control officers estimate that 89% of water contamination comes from commercial fertilizer and manure that\u2019s been spread on cropland. Unlike municipal water systems, which are tested regularly, private well owners are entirely responsible for the quality of their water. Various regulations and initiatives have been implemented over the years to address the issue, but as industrial agriculture continues to grow, many residents are demanding more urgent action.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: address the issue, demanding more urgent action\npolicy: \ntechnology: animal agriculture, commercial fertilizer, manure, industrial agriculture"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710771943,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

{"text":"Like the sanctuaries created for elephants or big cats rescued from poor conditions, a whale seaside sanctuary provides them with a natural habitat and prioritises their wellbeing above all else. They have much more space to explore, deeper waters, a sandy bottom and marine life such as birds, fish and crabs to interact with. People can visit sanctuaries to see the whales from a distance but they are not made to perform. The Whale Sanctuary Project is setting up a seaside sanctuary in Canada as well as promoting others around the world to allow once-captive cetaceans to live out their lives in a natural ocean environment. After causing them so much anguish, says Vinick, \u201cwe need to do right for what we\u2019ve done.\u201d *** But captivity has not ended. According to the WDC, there are about 3,600 captive whales and dolphins in about 58 countries today, including at least 56 orcas. WDC wants breeding, transfers between parks, and performances to stop and for welfare standards to improve. Legislation is being tightened up, with new laws in Canada, France, the US and South Korea.

We\u2019re \u2026 drowning.\u201d If Europe\u2019s farmers have called a temporary halt to their protests in France and Germany \u2013 awaiting what one French farmer called \u201cproof of love, not just words of love\u201d from their respective governments \u2013 they have only just got going in Spain. In scenes now familiar from Poland to Portugal, angry farmers last week blocked roads, a port and a large wholesale market, and plan to continue through February.

In recent weeks, large conurbations including Paris and Lyon have been blockaded.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/10/theyre-drowning-us-in-regulations-how-europes-furious-farmers-took-on-brussels-and-won_0","publication_date":"2024-02-10T14:00:43Z"},"_input_hash":-46295786,"_task_hash":-273686460,"tokens":[{"text":"On","start":0,"end":2,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":3,"end":6,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"outskirts","start":7,"end":16,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":17,"end":19,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":20,"end":23,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"northern","start":24,"end":32,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"Spanish","start":33,"end":40,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"city","start":41,"end":45,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":46,"end":48,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"Pamplona","start":49,"end":57,"id":9,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":57,"end":58,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":59,"end":60,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"green","start":61,"end":66,"id":12,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":66,"end":67,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"red","start":68,"end":71,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":72,"end":75,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"blue","start":76,"end":80,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"stream","start":81,"end":87,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":88,"end":90,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"New","start":91,"end":94,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"Holland","start":95,"end":102,"id":20,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":102,"end":103,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"John","start":104,"end":108,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"Deere","start":109,"end":114,"id":23,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":114,"end":115,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"Massey","start":116,"end":122,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"Ferguson","start":123,"end":131,"id":26,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":131,"end":132,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"Fendt","start":133,"end":138,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":139,"end":142,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"Deutz","start":143,"end":148,"id":30,"ws":false},{"text":"-","start":148,"end":149,"id":31,"ws":false},{"text":"Fahr","start":149,"end":153,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"tractors","start":154,"end":162,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"trundled","start":163,"end":171,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"forwards","start":172,"end":180,"id":35,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":180,"end":181,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"horns","start":182,"end":187,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"honking","start":188,"end":195,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":196,"end":199,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"orange","start":200,"end":206,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"lights","start":207,"end":213,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"flashing","start":214,"end":222,"id":42,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":222,"end":223,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"Under","start":224,"end":229,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"drizzly","start":230,"end":237,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"grey","start":238,"end":242,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"skies","start":243,"end":248,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":249,"end":252,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"escorted","start":253,"end":261,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":262,"end":264,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"navy","start":265,"end":269,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"blue","start":270,"end":274,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"Polic\u00eda","start":275,"end":282,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"Nacional","start":283,"end":291,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"vans","start":292,"end":296,"id":55,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":296,"end":297,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"few","start":298,"end":301,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"were","start":302,"end":306,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":307,"end":309,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":310,"end":313,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"mood","start":314,"end":318,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":319,"end":321,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"explain","start":322,"end":329,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":330,"end":333,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"motives","start":334,"end":341,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":342,"end":345,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"their","start":346,"end":351,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"demonstration","start":352,"end":365,"id":68,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":365,"end":366,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"but","start":367,"end":370,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":371,"end":372,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"young","start":373,"end":378,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"farmer","start":379,"end":385,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"from","start":386,"end":390,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":391,"end":394,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"nearby","start":395,"end":401,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"town","start":402,"end":406,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":407,"end":409,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"Estella","start":410,"end":417,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"threw","start":418,"end":423,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"open","start":424,"end":428,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"his","start":429,"end":432,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"cab","start":433,"end":436,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"door","start":437,"end":441,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"to

We\u2019re \u2026 drowning.\u201d If Europe\u2019s farmers have called a temporary halt to their protests in France and Germany \u2013 awaiting what one French farmer called \u201cproof of love, not just words of love\u201d from their respective governments \u2013 they have only just got going in Spain. In scenes now familiar from Poland to Portugal, angry farmers last week blocked roads, a port and a large wholesale market, and plan to continue through February. Italian farmers also took to their tractors last week, converging on the outskirts of Rome and staging a symbolic drive-past of the Colosseum on Friday. In recent weeks, large conurbations including Paris and Lyon have been blockaded.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: protests, blocked roads\npolicy: \ntechnology: tractors, microorganisms"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710771975,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

{"text":"Now I am retired I am free to follow leads, and I\u2019ve learned so much from open access papers, the internet and fossil communities on social media. In some cases I have been treated badly by academics who do not want to look at my fossils because they are in a private collection. You do have to have a thick skin. Others have been very supportive. No academic research has been done on these fossils in Weymouth at all. I have 350 pieces of pterosaur, which were flying reptiles. They flew over these seas for 160m years \u2013 that\u2019s a damn sight longer than humans have been around!

{"text":"True blue test Horseshoe crabs evolved around 450 million years ago, long before the appearance of dinosaurs. There are four species: three from Asia and one that lives along the east coast of North America. The last is the main source of crabs for bleeding. The blood of horseshoes contains cells that are exceptionally sensitive to toxic bacteria. When those cells meet invading micro-organisms, they form clots and so protect the rest of the horseshoe crab\u2019s body, a phenomenon that scientists exploited to develop the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test in the 1970s. This can determine if medical products, such as vaccines, have been contaminated with dangerous bacteria. To obtain supplies of the blood needed to make these tests, hundreds of thousands of horseshoe crabs are gathered every year. Their blood is extracted and the animals are then returned to their shoreline homes.

There are four species: three from Asia and one that lives along the east coast of North America. The last is the main source of crabs for bleeding. The blood of horseshoes contains cells that are exceptionally sensitive to toxic bacteria. When those cells meet invading micro-organisms, they form clots and so protect the rest of the horseshoe crab\u2019s body, a phenomenon that scientists exploited to develop the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test in the 1970s. This can determine if medical products, such as vaccines, have been contaminated with dangerous bacteria. To obtain supplies of the blood needed to make these tests, hundreds of thousands of horseshoe crabs are gathered every year. Their blood is extracted and the animals are then returned to their shoreline homes. One estimate, made in 2021, suggested that of 718,809 horseshoe crabs collected for these bleedings, a total of 112,104 died, around 15%. Other conservation groups put that death toll at around 30% or more, however.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test, vaccines"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772006,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"The G77 plus China group is the largest bloc operating in the UN climate talks. The diverse coalition includes the world\u2019s most populous countries and major emerging economies such as India, China, Brazil and Indonesia; significant fossil fuel producers such as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Nigeria; and some of the world\u2019s most climate vulnerable nations such as Bangladesh, Vanuatu and Yemen. Most countries belong to multiple blocs, which may have competing priorities. But developing countries have long been united in demanding that developed countries honor their legally binding obligations under the Paris agreement \u2013 and deliver on the means of implementation. In other words when it comes to transitioning away from fossil fuels, developed countries must go first, start immediately, stop expansion plans, and provide fair financial assistance so the rest of the world can work towards the same ends. The technical term for this is common but differentiated responsibility (CBDR), and is set out within the Paris accords. The 2015 agreement requires each country to create and implement a nationally determined contribution (NDC) that includes mitigation, adaptation and the means \u2013 finance, technology transfer and capacity building \u2013 by which this would be implemented. But this hasn\u2019t happened. As it stands, developing countries face a shortfall of trillions of dollars, which is preventing them from implementing mitigation and adaptation measures as the climate crisis deepens. The G77 presidency rotates annually, and Pedroso will next week hand over the baton to Uganda \u2013 where the government is working with neighboring Tanzania and the French conglomerate TotalEnergies to construct one of the world\u2019s largest fossil fuel projects, the 900-mile east Africa crude oil

Most countries belong to multiple blocs, which may have competing priorities. But developing countries have long been united in demanding that developed countries honor their legally binding obligations under the Paris agreement \u2013 and deliver on the means of implementation. In other words when it comes to transitioning away from fossil fuels, developed countries must go first, start immediately, stop expansion plans, and provide fair financial assistance so the rest of the world can work towards the same ends. The technical term for this is common but differentiated responsibility (CBDR), and is set out within the Paris accords. The 2015 agreement requires each country to create and implement a nationally determined contribution (NDC) that includes mitigation, adaptation and the means \u2013 finance, technology transfer and capacity building \u2013 by which this would be implemented. But this hasn\u2019t happened. As it stands, developing countries face a shortfall of trillions of dollars, which is preventing them from implementing mitigation and adaptation measures as the climate crisis deepens. The G77 presidency rotates annually, and Pedroso will next week hand over the baton to Uganda \u2013 where the government is working with neighboring Tanzania and the French conglomerate TotalEnergies to construct one of the world\u2019s largest fossil fuel projects, the 900-mile east Africa crude oil pipeline.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: transitioning away from fossil fuels, demanding developed countries honor their legally binding obligations\npolicy: Paris agreement, common but differentiated responsibility (CBDR)\ntechnology: fossil fuels, technology transfer, capacity building, east Africa crude oil pipeline"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772032,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"Australia has already set a net zero by 2050 target and a 43% reduction by 2030. However, research from two leading scientists who contribute to the UN climate panel\u2019s global assessment of climate targets has suggested Australia would need to set a 2035 target of 90% to do its fair share of keeping global temperatures to 1.5C. UN experts have been concerned for years that progress to reduce sediment, nutrients and pollution running into the reef\u2019s waters has been too slow. The government said about $534m from a $1.2bn funding package up to 2030 would \u201caccelerate actions to meeting water quality targets\u201d. Queensland had not implemented its sustainable fisheries strategy by the end of 2023, as promised, and was still finalising a commitment to remove gillnet fishing from the northern third of the reef. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said: \u201cLabor is acting on climate change, improving local water quality, protecting our marine life, dealing with invasive species and investing a record amount of money into reef programs.\u201d Unesco and its science advisers at the International Union for Conservation of Nature will consider the government\u2019s report before making recommendations ahead of the world heritage committee\u2019s July meeting in New Delhi. On Friday the government will also release a strategy to restore and protect wetlands in the catchment of the Great Barrier

{"text":"Glen Affric in the Highlands is home to deer, ospreys, otters and one of Scotland\u2019s largest Caledonian pine woods. Often described as one of the country\u2019s most beautiful glens, its scenic landscapes and diverse wildlife are such that it is protected as a national nature reserve. Now, local community groups have launched a bid for it to become Scotland\u2019s third national park, in a race which has so far seen more than 10 other areas also submit their interest. The latest bid, submitted by Strathglass community council and supported by a number of local groups, proposes an Affric and Loch Ness national park that would encompass a portion of Loch Ness as well as Glen Affric, stretching from the Dundreggan rewilding centre to the south, mountainous Kintail to the west and the historic village of Beauly to the east. \u201cThe area is already popular with visitors, providing an important income stream in rural areas,\u201d said Humphrey Clarke, the chair of Strathglass community council. \u201cNational park status would provide access to funding and empower local people.\u201d Steve Micklewright, the chief executive of the rewilding charity Trees For Life, which is supporting the bid, said it could bring significant environmental benefits to the area. \u201cA new national park could enable nature restoration on a major scale in this stunning landscape of mountains, glens, lochs and ancient forests. It would help biodiversity to recover and lock in carbon in trees and peatland to help with the climate crisis,\u201d he said. The Scottish government committed to the creation of a new national park by 2026 in the Bute House agreement, a power-sharing arrangement between the SNP and the Scottish Greens.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/27/glens-lochs-and-isles-battle-to-be-scotlands-next-national-park_0","publication_date":"2024-01-27T15:00:38Z"},"_input_hash":897207320,"_task_hash":1007639239,"tokens":[{"text":"Glen","start":0,"end":4,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"Affric","start":5,"end":11,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":12,"end":14,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":15,"end":18,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"Highlands","start":19,"end":28,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":29,"end":31,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"home","start":32,"end":36,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":37,"end":39,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"deer","start":40,"end":44,"id":8,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":44,"end":45,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"ospreys","start":46,"end":53,"id":10,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":53,"end":54,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"otters","start":55,"end":61,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":62,"end":65,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"one","start":66,"end":69,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":70,"end":72,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"Scotland","start":73,"end":81,"id":16,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":81,"end":83,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"largest","start":84,"end":91,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"Caledonian","start":92,"end":102,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"pine","start":103,"end":107,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"woods","start":108,"end":113,"id":21,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":113,"end":114,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"Often","start":115,"end":120,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"described","start":121,"end":130,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":131,"end":133,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"one","start":134,"end":137,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":138,"end":140,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":141,"end":144,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"country","start":145,"end":152,"id":29,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":152,"end":154,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"most","start":155,"end":159,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"beautiful","start":160,"end":169,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"glens","start":170,"end":175,"id":33,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":175,"end":176,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"its","start":177,"end":180,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"scenic","start":181,"end":187,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"landscapes","start":188,"end":198,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":199,"end":202,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"diverse","start":203,"end":210,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"wildlife","start":211,"end":219,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":220,"end":223,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"such","start":224,"end":228,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":229,"end":233,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":234,"end":236,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":237,"end":239,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"protected","start":240,"end":249,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":250,"end":252,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":253,"end":254,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"national","start":255,"end":263,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"nature","start":264,"end":270,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"reserve","start":271,"end":278,"id":51,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":278,"end":279,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"Now","start":280,"end":283,"id":53,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":283,"end":284,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"local","start":285,"end":290,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"community","start":291,"end":300,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"groups","start":301,"end":307,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"have","start":308,"end":312,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"launched","start":313,"end":321,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":322,"end":323,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"bid","start":324,"end":327,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":328,"end":331,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":332,"end":334,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":335,"end":337,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"become","start":338,"end":344,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"Scotland","start":345,"end":353,"id":66,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":353,"end":355,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"third","start":356,"end":361,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"national","start":362,"end":370,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"park","start":371,"end":375,"id":70,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":375,"end":376,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":377,"end":379,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":380,"end":381,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"race","start":382,"end":386,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"which","start":387,"end":392,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"has","start":393,"end":396,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"so","start":397,"end":399,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"far","start":400,"end":403,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"seen","start":404,"end":408,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"more","start":409,"end":413,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"than","start":414,"end":418,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"10","start":419,"end":421,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"other","start":422,"end":427,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"areas","start":428,"end":433,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"also","start":434,"end":

{"text":"Aliyev\u2019s government last week appointed a former executive of its state oil and gas company as president of the Cop29 climate talks that are scheduled to take place in Baku this November. Mukhtar Babayev was appointed Azerbaijan\u2019s ecology and natural resources minister in 2018, after a 26-year career at oil and gas company Socar. Critics of the appointment have drawn parallels with the appointment of Sultan Al Jaber to preside over last year\u2019s Cop28 climate summit in Dubai, while still in his role as the chief executive of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. Azerbaijan\u2019s government hopes to fill the gap in Europe\u2019s gas supplies left by Russia after its invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago. But critics have warned that Azerbaijan\u2019s fossil fuel interests have played a direct role in funding the military aggression against ethnic Armenians in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Global Witness said Azerbaijan\u2019s share of two large oil and gas projects operated by BP had earned its government more than four times its military spending since 2020 when the long-running conflict erupted again. More than half of Nagorno-Karabakh\u2019s population have fled to Armenia in what Yerevan has described as \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d amid a military blitz by Azerbaijan to reclaim full control over the breakaway region. Dominic Eagleton, a senior campaigner at Global Witness, said: \u201cAs we hurtle towards climate collapse, we\u2019re now being asked to put our future in the hands of Azerbaijan, a petrostate that\u2019s propped up by oil super majors and is massively increasing its gas production. We need climate policymaking to be run by climate leaders, not countries with a vested interest in keeping the world hooked on oil and gas.\u201d","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/08/cop29-host-azerbaijan-to-hike-gas-output-by-a-third-over-next-decade_1","publication_date":"2024-01-08T06:00:42Z"},"_input_hash":1938340139,"_task_hash":-1508152901,"tokens":[{"text":"Aliyev","start":0,"end":6,"id":0,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":6,"end":8,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"government","start":9,"end":19,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"last","start":20,"end":24,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"week","start":25,"end":29,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"appointed","start":30,"end":39,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":40,"end":41,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"former","start":42,"end":48,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"executive","start":49,"end":58,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":59,"end":61,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"its","start":62,"end":65,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"state","start":66,"end":71,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"oil","start":72,"end":75,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":76,"end":79,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"gas","start":80,"end":83,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"company","start":84,"end":91,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":92,"end":94,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"president","start":95,"end":104,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":105,"end":107,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":108,"end":111,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"Cop29","start":112,"end":117,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"climate","start":118,"end":125,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"talks","start":126,"end":131,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":132,"end":136,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":137,"end":140,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"scheduled","start":141,"end":150,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":151,"end":153,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"take","start":154,"end":158,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"place","start":159,"end":164,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":165,"end":167,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"Baku","start":168,"end":172,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"this","start":173,"end":177,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"November","start":178,"end":186,"id":32,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":186,"end":187,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"Mukhtar","start":188,"end":195,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"Babayev","start":196,"end":203,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"was","start":204,"end":207,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"appointed","start":208,"end":217,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"Azerbaijan","start":218,"end":228,"id":38,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":228,"end":230,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"ecology","start":231,"end":238,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":239,"end":242,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"natural","start":243,"end":250,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"resources","start":251,"end":260,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"minister","start":261,"end":269,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":270,"end":272,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"2018","start":273,"end":277,"id":46,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":277,"end":278,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"after","start":279,"end":284,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":285,"end":286,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"26","start":287,"end":289,"id":50,"ws":false},{"text":"-","start":289,"end":290,"id":51,"ws":false},{"text":"year","start":290,"end":294,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"career","start":295,"end":301,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"at","start":302,"end":304,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"oil","start":305,"end":308,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":309,"end":312,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"gas","start":313,"end":316,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"company","start":317,"end":324,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"Socar","start":325,"end":330,"id":59,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":330,"end":331,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"Critics","start":332,"end":339,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":340,"end":342,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":343,"end":346,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"appointment","start":347,"end":358,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"have","start":359,"end":363,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"drawn","start":364,"end":369,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"parallels","start":370,"end":379,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":380,"end":384,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":385,"end":388,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"appointment","start":389,"end":400,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":401,"end":403,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"Sultan","start":404,"end":410,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"Al","start":411,"end":413,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"Jaber","start":414,"end":419,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":420,"end":422,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"preside","start":423,"end":430,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"over","start":431,"end":435,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"last","start":436,"end":440,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"year","start":441,"end":445,"id":79,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":445,"end":447,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"Cop28","start":448,"end":453,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"climate","start":454,"end":461,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"summit","start":462,"end":468,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":469,"end":471,"id":8

Mukhtar Babayev was appointed Azerbaijan\u2019s ecology and natural resources minister in 2018, after a 26-year career at oil and gas company Socar. Critics of the appointment have drawn parallels with the appointment of Sultan Al Jaber to preside over last year\u2019s Cop28 climate summit in Dubai, while still in his role as the chief executive of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. Azerbaijan\u2019s government hopes to fill the gap in Europe\u2019s gas supplies left by Russia after its invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago. But critics have warned that Azerbaijan\u2019s fossil fuel interests have played a direct role in funding the military aggression against ethnic Armenians in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Global Witness said Azerbaijan\u2019s share of two large oil and gas projects operated by BP had earned its government more than four times its military spending since 2020 when the long-running conflict erupted again. More than half of Nagorno-Karabakh\u2019s population have fled to Armenia in what Yerevan has described as \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d amid a military blitz by Azerbaijan to reclaim full control over the breakaway region. Dominic Eagleton, a senior campaigner at Global Witness, said: \u201cAs we hurtle towards climate collapse, we\u2019re now being asked to put our future in the hands of Azerbaijan, a petrostate that\u2019s propped up by oil super majors and is massively increasing its gas production.

{"text":"But for now it seems as if the only answer is for people to wade in and pick it up themselves. All over the world, individuals, groups and governments are picking up the baton and launching initiatives against the rubbish filling the land and oceans. Their efforts range from local beach cleanups, to innovative strategies such as the \u201cbubble barrier\u201d that is being trialled in the Netherlands, to international efforts such as the Ocean Cleanup. Sungai Watch in Bali is one of these many valiant teams. It was set up by Bencheghib and her siblings Gary and Sam, who are French-born but grew up on the beaches of Bali and became aware of the growing plastic problem from a very young age. As teenagers, they started a weekly cleanup, roping in schoolmates and local businesses. \u201cBack then, everyone looked at us in a bit of a weird mood. They were really asking the questions: why do you even bother? It\u2019s just going to disappear with the waves,\u201d Kelly says.

{"text":"Last month was the warmest February on record globally, making it the ninth month in a row with record temperatures for the time of year, scientists have said. Global sea surface temperatures are also at their highest ever recorded, data from the EU\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service shows. The data shows February was 1.77C warmer than the pre-industrial average for the month, from 1850 to 1900, and 0.81C above 1991-2020 levels. The global average temperature for the past 12 months \u2013 between March 2023 and February 2024 \u2013 was the highest on record, at 1.56C above pre-industrial levels. That puts the world temporarily above the 1.5C threshold beyond which, over the long term, the worst impacts of climate change are expected. Daily global average temperatures were \u201cexceptionally high\u201d during the first half of the month, reaching 2C above 1850-1900 levels on four days from 8 to 11 February, Copernicus said. European temperatures in February 2024 were 3.3C above the 1991-2020 average for the month, with temperatures well above average seen in central and eastern Europe, the figures showed. Europe\u2019s winter, from December to February, was the second warmest on record for the continent.

Global sea surface temperatures are also at their highest ever recorded, data from the EU\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service shows. The data shows February was 1.77C warmer than the pre-industrial average for the month, from 1850 to 1900, and 0.81C above 1991-2020 levels. The global average temperature for the past 12 months \u2013 between March 2023 and February 2024 \u2013 was the highest on record, at 1.56C above pre-industrial levels. That puts the world temporarily above the 1.5C threshold beyond which, over the long term, the worst impacts of climate change are expected. Daily global average temperatures were \u201cexceptionally high\u201d during the first half of the month, reaching 2C above 1850-1900 levels on four days from 8 to 11 February, Copernicus said. European temperatures in February 2024 were 3.3C above the 1991-2020 average for the month, with temperatures well above average seen in central and eastern Europe, the figures showed. Europe\u2019s winter, from December to February, was the second warmest on record for the continent. Average global sea surface temperatures for February, outside the polar regions, were the highest for any month on record, at 21.06C, exceeding the previous record of 20.98C set in August 2023. The average daily sea surface temperature reached a new absolute high of 21.09C at the end of the month, Copernicus said.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: EU\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service, microorganisms"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772112,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

{"text":"Sources within the party have argued that this spending target was designed to achieve more than a virtually zero-carbon power system by 2030 by creating homegrown green jobs and boosting local supply chain companies. The 2030 target could still be achieved with lower public spending by overhauling the UK\u2019s regulatory and planning systems to help private sector investment to play a bigger role, one source said. Some of the biggest barriers to the UK\u2019s green energy targets hinge on significant hurdles in the UK\u2019s planning system, which has slowed the pace at which green projects can connect to the power grid. The Labour party also accused the government of overseeing an \u201cenergy security disaster\u201d last year after it failed to attract any new investors to a key offshore wind subsidy auction. Investments in big green energy projects and grid infrastructure are expected to lower household energy bills in the long term by making cheap renewable energy more available. Research by Ember found households could save \u00a3300 a year on energy bills by 2030 by running a 98% zero carbon electricity grid. \u201cThe investment that a government makes now, will pay for itself in the future,\u201d Fox said. \u201cIt will be paid back through lower energy bills because the greener our energy system becomes the cheaper it will be for the consumer.

The 2030 target could still be achieved with lower public spending by overhauling the UK\u2019s regulatory and planning systems to help private sector investment to play a bigger role, one source said. Some of the biggest barriers to the UK\u2019s green energy targets hinge on significant hurdles in the UK\u2019s planning system, which has slowed the pace at which green projects can connect to the power grid.

{"text":"Reducing particle pollution to meet World Health Organization (WHO) guideline levels would have reduced premature deaths in Europe by 238,000 in 2021. More than 80% of the ammonia that leaches into our air comes from farming, specifically nitrogen fertilisers and animal waste, but the researchers also found sources in towns and cities. Ammonia next to busy roads was about 40% higher than other parts of towns and cities due to emissions from diesel and petrol exhausts. It was also greater in the mornings, perhaps due to greater emissions when petrol engines are started from cold. This may directly produce particle pollution. Tighter standards for new vehicles could help. Ammonia is likely to be adopted as a fuel for shipping and power generation in the future, but agriculture will remain its main source.

Ammonia next to busy roads was about 40% higher than other parts of towns and cities due to emissions from diesel and petrol exhausts. It was also greater in the mornings, perhaps due to greater emissions when petrol engines are started from cold. This may directly produce particle pollution.

{"text":"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast a strong El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon between October and this March, resulting in hot, dry weather and little rainfall. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in its November update that this was likely to result in the \u201cdelayed onset of rainfall and prolonged dry spells\u201d, and could lead to drought conditions in Zimbabwe. By the close of 2023, it said, \u201cthe greater part of Zimbabwe had received less than 50% of the seasonal accumulated rainfall when compared to the long-term average\u201d. Conservation groups in Hwange are now rushing to drill more boreholes in a bid to spread the elephants out into areas where food is more readily available. They are also installing solar-powered systems on existing boreholes to extend pumping hours to meet the expected pressure in the hot season from August. \u201cWe are aware that we might have an El Ni\u00f1o and a big drought in 2024,\u201d Lane said. \u201cWe will see what we can do to mitigate that, but it will just be survival of the fittest \u2026 if there\u2019s another drought we\u2019ll have to go through the same thing again.\u201d Droughts have caused mass die-offs of elephants in Zimbabwe before \u2013 in 2019, more than 200 died over two months due to a lack of water. Veterinarians and conservationists involved in Hwange said that elephants initially died in a cluster around one of the most used water points in the park. Later on, the deaths became widespread and were not appearing in clusters, they

{"text":"Workers at environmental charities have said bold words on inclusion are not being matched with action, as research shows the sector still lags far behind others in racial diversity. Only about one in 20 workers in the environmental charity sector identified as an ethnic minority last year, according to a survey of organisations, compared with one in eight in the wider UK workforce. About the same proportion was represented in the senior leadership of organisations, the research found. The findings reveal the environment, climate, sustainability and conservation sector as one of the UK\u2019s least diverse. One hundred and forty-two environmental organisations, representing almost 13,000 employees, submitted data to the research, carried out by the Race (racial action on the climate emergency) Report campaign, up from 91 the previous year. In spite of the disappointing findings \u2013 one percentage point down on last year\u2019s, although more organisations were now taking part \u2013 many organisations said they were intensifying efforts to improve ethnic diversity and inclusion. One in 10 reported publishing or being in the process of publishing data on their race equity pay gap compared with one in 20 in 2022; two-thirds reported hiring a senior leader with responsibility for equality, diversity and inclusion, up from 44%; and 85% said they were carrying out reviews of the effectiveness of that work. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see how much the sector\u2019s engagement with racial diversity has grown in just one year,\u201d said Manu Maunganidze, of the Race Report. \u201cThe more data we have at our disposal, the better equipped we are to shape best

{"text":"Sungai Watch has now initiated more than 1,000 weekly cleanups with the help of volunteers and collected a total of more than 1.7m kg of waste. The barriers are an effective mechanism, according to a 2019 study by the marine pollution researcher Muhammad Reza Cordova at Indonesia\u2019s research agency BRIN. He found, over 13 months, that rivers with floating net booms had between seven and 10 times less debris than those without. Reza and his team recommended that the government install nets at least in the 10 main rivers of Java, Indonesia\u2019s most populous island, but take-up has been slow, despite the government\u2019s target to reduce marine plastic pollution by 70% by 2025. \u201cSo instead, we see non-government people taking actions, as we can see in many instances, because people just can\u2019t stand it any more,\u201d he said. The Sungai Watch team sorts through its rubbish sacks: a huge proportion of the waste is plastic bags, nappies, sanitary waste, or cables, all of which, for now, has to go into landfill. The remaining waste is washed and pressed by machines. Some of the plastics will be turned into furniture under the group\u2019s social enterprise arm, Sungai Design, to be launched in February. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re processing around maybe 20% of what we collect.

The barriers are an effective mechanism, according to a 2019 study by the marine pollution researcher Muhammad Reza Cordova at Indonesia\u2019s research agency BRIN. He found, over 13 months, that rivers with floating net booms had between seven and 10 times less debris than those without. Reza and his team recommended that the government install nets at least in the 10 main rivers of Java, Indonesia\u2019s most populous island, but take-up has been slow, despite the government\u2019s target to reduce marine plastic pollution by 70% by 2025. \u201cSo instead, we see non-government people taking actions, as we can see in many instances, because people just can\u2019t stand it any more,\u201d he said. The Sungai Watch team sorts through its rubbish sacks: a huge proportion of the waste is plastic bags, nappies, sanitary waste, or cables, all of which, for now, has to go into landfill. The remaining waste is washed and pressed by machines. Some of the plastics will be turned into furniture under the group\u2019s social enterprise arm, Sungai Design, to be launched in February. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re processing around maybe 20% of what we collect. So we have a giant garden of plastics that we\u2019re still not yet able to cater to,\u201d Gary Bencheghib said.\n'''"],"response":["project: Sungai Watch\ninitiative: weekly cleanups, install nets in rivers, reduce marine plastic pollution\npolicy: \ntechnology: floating net booms, plastic recycling machines"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772176,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"Baker, Withers, Dreher and their spouses met in May 2022 to discuss collaborating. \u201cWe found right from those early meetings that it was easy to talk,\u201d says Dreher. They asked for support from Oregon Consensus, an institution that sponsors complex conflict resolution, and spent the summer bringing together environmental groups, government agencies and local tribes to form the Partnership for Lake Abert and the Chewaucan. After the members of the group identified their points of disagreement, they realised that they lacked a sufficient body of facts, so they commissioned six months of research collecting scientific data, traditional tribal ecological knowledge, and ranchers\u2019 experiences. One of the main differences relates to the ranchers\u2019 water diversions. Ranchers argue that their flood irrigation mimics the way the marshes functioned before the land was settled and drained in the late 1800s. They say the marshes harbour an immense biodiversity of grasses \u2013 upwards of 50 species \u2013 and attract birds such as sandhill cranes, geese and black-necked stilts. \u201cThere\u2019s a symbiotic relationship between wildlife and ranching,\u201d says Keith Baker, Tess\u2019s husband. Conservation organisations and the Oregon state department of fish and wildlife supported the development of that flood irrigation in the 1980s. But Dreher disputes the claim that the practice mimics the marshes\u2019 natural hydrology, and says such water use should be reconsidered now that the effects of the increasing heat and water shortage in the west have become more

They asked for support from Oregon Consensus, an institution that sponsors complex conflict resolution, and spent the summer bringing together environmental groups, government agencies and local tribes to form the Partnership for Lake Abert and the Chewaucan. After the members of the group identified their points of disagreement, they realised that they lacked a sufficient body of facts, so they commissioned six months of research collecting scientific data, traditional tribal ecological knowledge, and ranchers\u2019 experiences. One of the main differences relates to the ranchers\u2019 water diversions. Ranchers argue that their flood irrigation mimics the way the marshes functioned before the land was settled and drained in the late 1800s. They say the marshes harbour an immense biodiversity of grasses \u2013 upwards of 50 species \u2013 and attract birds such as sandhill cranes, geese and black-necked stilts. \u201cThere\u2019s a symbiotic relationship between wildlife and ranching,\u201d says Keith Baker, Tess\u2019s husband. Conservation organisations and the Oregon state department of fish and wildlife supported the development of that flood irrigation in the 1980s. But Dreher disputes the claim that the practice mimics the marshes\u2019 natural hydrology, and says such water use should be reconsidered now that the effects of the increasing heat and water shortage in the west have become more visible.\n'''"],"response":["project: Partnership for Lake Abert and the Chewaucan\ninitiative: collaborating, forming the Partnership for Lake Abert and the Chewaucan, commissioning research\npolicy: \ntechnology: flood irrigation"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772186,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"In the summer of 2022, WWF, which has been concerned about the effects of global food production on wildlife and ecology, was scheduled to publish a report on fixing the food system called \u201cFeeling the Bite\u201d. It warned that about a million species were threatened. The hard-hitting report said in the UK and around the world \u201chow we eat is driving a food production system that is destroying the planet\u201d. It warned that a \u201cbroken\u201d food system was putting an impossible strain on nature. As well as highlighting the threat globally to Asian elephants and the maned wolf in South America, it documented the plight of the River Wye as a case study. It warned that the increase in phosphate-rich manure produced by poultry farms was causing deadly algae blooms that \u201csuffocate plants and fish, and leave birds such as kingfishers and dippers without food\u201d. The report was set to be published in 2022 but, the source claims, it was proposed that publication be deferred and the Wye case study removed amid concerns that environmental campaigners would highlight WWF\u2019s partnership with Tesco. A decision was later taken to shelve the report in its entirety. The source said that once the Wye case study had been removed, it raised questions about the report\u2019s overall strength. Tesco said this weekend it did not have any involvement in the report or the decision for it not to be

The hard-hitting report said in the UK and around the world \u201chow we eat is driving a food production system that is destroying the planet\u201d. It warned that a \u201cbroken\u201d food system was putting an impossible strain on nature. As well as highlighting the threat globally to Asian elephants and the maned wolf in South America, it documented the plight of the River Wye as a case study. It warned that the increase in phosphate-rich manure produced by poultry farms was causing deadly algae blooms that \u201csuffocate plants and fish, and leave birds such as kingfishers and dippers without food\u201d. The report was set to be published in 2022 but, the source claims, it was proposed that publication be deferred and the Wye case study removed amid concerns that environmental campaigners would highlight WWF\u2019s partnership with Tesco. A decision was later taken to shelve the report in its entirety. The source said that once the Wye case study had been removed, it raised questions about the report\u2019s overall strength. Tesco said this weekend it did not have any involvement in the report or the decision for it not to be published.\n'''"],"response":["project: Feeling the Bite\ninitiative: fixing the food system, driving a food production system\npolicy: \ntechnology: phosphate-rich manure, poultry farms"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772196,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

{"text":"\u201cI don\u2019t know what life means without coffee,\u201d he told the diners. Similarly, wine suffers when weather is volatile, as climate change makes it. Kass pointed out that wine growers in the iconic Champagne, France, region have been buying land in England in preparation for making wine there in the future, as parts of France grow too warm for certain varietals. Fourth course: coffee and chocolate sticky toffee pudding with pistachio hazelnut and vanilla chantilly The final course showcased several foods under threat in a small, tasty sticky toffee pudding, the last word of the last supper. Coffee and nuts, noted earlier in the dinner, featured in the toffee pudding and in a pressed wafer shaped like a leaf placed on top, made of pistachio and hazelnut. Collins said he wanted to use flour to note how staple crops like wheat, grown throughout the midwestern US, are part of the equation, too. Small declines in these staples bring the potential for economic shocks, higher food insecurity, migration changes and conflict, Kass said, and in that sense, they\u2019re perhaps the biggest concern. Chocolate\u2019s fate looks similar to coffee and wine: it has to be grown in specific areas, and warming could make those areas inhospitable to the plants that form the backbone of its economy and culture. Kass said the climate is on track to eliminate cacao tree production by 2050 if nothing changes. Chocolate production is concentrated near the equator, largely by small farmers whose work is a way of

Similarly, wine suffers when weather is volatile, as climate change makes it. Kass pointed out that wine growers in the iconic Champagne, France, region have been buying land in England in preparation for making wine there in the future, as parts of France grow too warm for certain varietals. Fourth course: coffee and chocolate sticky toffee pudding with pistachio hazelnut and vanilla chantilly The final course showcased several foods under threat in a small, tasty sticky toffee pudding, the last word of the last supper. Coffee and nuts, noted earlier in the dinner, featured in the toffee pudding and in a pressed wafer shaped like a leaf placed on top, made of pistachio and hazelnut. Collins said he wanted to use flour to note how staple crops like wheat, grown throughout the midwestern US, are part of the equation, too. Small declines in these staples bring the potential for economic shocks, higher food insecurity, migration changes and conflict, Kass said, and in that sense, they\u2019re perhaps the biggest concern. Chocolate\u2019s fate looks similar to coffee and wine: it has to be grown in specific areas, and warming could make those areas inhospitable to the plants that form the backbone of its economy and culture. Kass said the climate is on track to eliminate cacao tree production by 2050 if nothing changes. Chocolate production is concentrated near the equator, largely by small farmers whose work is a way of life.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: making wine in England, growing too warm for certain varietals\npolicy: \ntechnology: coffee, wine, pistachio, hazelnut, vanilla, wheat, cacao tree"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1710772206,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"Dr Tim Portas pulls the patient from a cardboard box, wraps him in a towel and touches a cotton bud on his eye to see if he can blink. Patient number 1,433,093 is one of about 3,500 Rainbow lorikeets that have come into the RSPCA\u2019s wildlife hospital near Brisbane since the beginning of the year with a mystery paralysis. This bird is one of the lucky ones. He can swallow and walk \u2013 albeit with a drunk-like gait, staggering across the triage room floor \u2013 so it\u2019s a quick injection of fluids and off to the aviary. \u201cHe\u2019s a got good prognosis for recovery,\u201d says Portas, the hospital\u2019s veterinary director. Across the corridor in the bird ward, a few dozen lorikeets are paired up in cages for more intensive care and hand feeding. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads \u201cThey\u2019re such a beautiful bird, but they\u2019re cheeky and cranky little buggers,\u201d says Jaimee Blouse, a senior nurse at the hospital. \u201cThey bite hard and they have sharp claws,\u201d she says, holding up her hands to show the scratches of treating hundreds of the distressed birds. By the time we have returned from the aviary, there are another dozen lorikeets inside boxes in a reception area waiting to be seen. In recent weeks, about 100 paralysed lorikeets a day have been coming in to the

Patient number 1,433,093 is one of about 3,500 Rainbow lorikeets that have come into the RSPCA\u2019s wildlife hospital near Brisbane since the beginning of the year with a mystery paralysis. This bird is one of the lucky ones.

Climate Defiance, which disrupted events featuring a string of Biden administration officials this year, and targeted Darren Woods, CEO of ExxonMobil, in December, will consider protesting at events staged by both Democrats and Republicans on the campaign trail after concluding that its \u201cvery disruptive\u201d action was bearing fruit. In an interview, Michael Greenberg, the group\u2019s co-founder, told the Guardian it will also focus \u201cmore and more\u201d on state-level demonstrations designed to deter policymakers from approving fossil fuel projects. Since demonstrating outside the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner in the spring, its activists have staged protests at events featuring a string of senior federal officials, including the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, and the energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm.

In terms of mental health and wellbeing, I just know from my own life, stopping and looking out at the birds just gives me that moment of otherness which I find really restorative.\u201d Research showed that people spent more time in nature during the Covid pandemic and lockdowns but a recent report from the Office for National Statistics found many people had reverted to their pre-pandemic habits, with over a million fewer people now spending time in nature. Dr Amir Khan, the president of the RSPB said: \u201cTaking a moment out of my busy life to enjoy the birds that visit my garden is incredibly beneficial for my mental health, helping to increase serotonin, known as the happy brain chemical, which lifts my mood and reduces stress levels. \u201cI\u2019d encourage everyone who can to take part in this year\u2019s Big Garden Birdwatch, whether in a garden, a balcony or a local green space.

{"text":"England is launching a biodiversity credit scheme this week that attempts to force all new road and housebuilding projects to benefit nature, rather than damage it. The \u201cnature market\u201d, called biodiversity net gain (BNG), means all new building projects must achieve a 10% net gain in biodiversity or habitat. If a woodland is destroyed by a road, for example, another needs to be recreated. This can happen either on site or elsewhere. The requirement becomes law under the Town and Country Planning Act on 12 February for larger sites, and on 2 April 2024 for smaller sites. The scheme will make people think about how to minimise and mitigate the ecosystem impact of new developments, said Natalie Duffus, a biology and geographer researcher from the University of Oxford, who analysed the impact of BNG trials on conservation. \u201cIn theory, it could restore lots of habitats,\u201d she added. The government has a target of building 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s. Land affected by those developments must be compensated for under the new rules. Internationally, \u201cit\u2019s one of the most ambitious schemes we\u2019ve seen\u201d, said

Internationally, \u201cit\u2019s one of the most ambitious schemes we\u2019ve seen\u201d, said Duffus.\n'''"],"response":["project: biodiversity credit scheme\ninitiative: force all new road and housebuilding projects to benefit nature, achieve a 10% net gain in biodiversity or habitat, minimise and mitigate the ecosystem impact of new developments, restore lots of habitats\npolicy: Town and Country Planning Act\ntechnology: "]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772268,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"A commitment to restoration is essential, according to Inger Andersen, executive director of UNEP, who noted it was no longer enough to merely protect what was left of Africa\u2019s fertile land. This continent will be home to a quarter of the world\u2019s population in little more than a generation and many areas have already degraded into semi-barren drylands. \u201cInitiatives like TREES are playing an important role in reversing decades of ecosystem degradation, especially across the Sahel, pushing back desertification, increasing climate resilience and improving the wellbeing of farmers and their communities,\u201d Andersen said in announcing the World Restoration Flagship. While there is no doubt about the need for reforestation, there are historical reasons to be sceptical about the effectiveness of such programmes. Expectations are often too high. A 2019 study suggesting the climate crisis could be significantly eased by planting a trillion trees across the world was later debunked as unrealistic because there was not enough suitable land. Many governments have launched mass tree-planting campaigns, but after the initial day or two of publicity, there is rarely sufficient irrigation, protection and other follow-up to ensure seeds and saplings grow into trunks and branches. Often such national initiatives are little more than greenwashing distractions from far greater forest destruction elsewhere. Kenya, for example, has launched numerous tree-planting initiatives in recent decades, including the Million Operation Gavisha in 1977, the Trees Campaign in 2006, the Greening Kenya Initiative in 2010 and the Accelerated National Tree Growing Campaign 2022, yet overall, it has lost 11% of its tree cover since 2000. The situation has stabilised somewhat in the past two years under the current president, William Ruto, who has declared an annual tree-planting holiday and set a national target to plant 15bn trees and raise tree cover to 30% by 2032.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/13/seven-times-size-of-manhattan-the-african-tree-planting-project-making-a-difference_1","publication_date":"2024-03-13T12:00:27Z"},"_input_hash":1162935902,"_task_hash":268958006,"tokens":[{"text":"A","start":0,"end":1,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"commitment","start":2,"end":12,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":13,"end":15,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"restoration","start":16,"end":27,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":28,"end":30,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"essential","start":31,"end":40,"id":5,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":40,"end":41,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"according","start":42,"end":51,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":52,"end":54,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"Inger","start":55,"end":60,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"Andersen","start":61,"end":69,"id":10,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":69,"end":70,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"executive","start":71,"end":80,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"director","start":81,"end":89,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":90,"end":92,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"UNEP","start":93,"end":97,"id":15,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":97,"end":98,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"who","start":99,"end":102,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"noted","start":103,"end":108,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":109,"end":111,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"was","start":112,"end":115,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"no","start":116,"end":118,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"longer","start":119,"end":125,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"enough","start":126,"end":132,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":133,"end":135,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"merely","start":136,"end":142,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"protect","start":143,"end":150,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"what","start":151,"end":155,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"was","start":156,"end":159,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"left","start":160,"end":164,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":165,"end":167,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"Africa","start":168,"end":174,"id":31,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":174,"end":176,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"fertile","start":177,"end":184,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"land","start":185,"end":189,"id":34,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":189,"end":190,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"This","start":191,"end":195,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"continent","start":196,"end":205,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"will","start":206,"end":210,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":211,"end":213,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"home","start":214,"end":218,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":219,"end":221,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":222,"end":223,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"quarter","start":224,"end":231,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":232,"end":234,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":235,"end":238,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"world","start":239,"end":244,"id":46,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":244,"end":246,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"population","start":247,"end":257,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":258,"end":260,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"little","start":261,"end":267,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"more","start":268,"end":272,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"than","start":273,"end":277,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":278,"end":279,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"generation","start":280,"end":290,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":291,"end":294,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"many","start":295,"end":299,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"areas","start":300,"end":305,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"have","start":306,"end":310,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"already","start":311,"end":318,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"degraded","start":319,"end":327,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"into","start":328,"end":332,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"semi","start":333,"end":337,"id":62,"ws":false},{"text":"-","start":337,"end":338,"id":63,"ws":false},{"text":"barren","start":338,"end":344,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"drylands","start":345,"end":353,"id":65,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":353,"end":354,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"\u201c","start":355,"end":356,"id":67,"ws":false},{"text":"Initiatives","start":356,"end":367,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"like","start":368,"end":372,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"TREES","start":373,"end":378,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":379,"end":382,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"playing","start":383,"end":390,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"an","start":391,"end":393,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"important","start":394,"end":403,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"role","start":404,"end":408,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":409,"end":411,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"reversing","start":412,"end":421,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"decades","start":422,"end":429,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":430,"end":432,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"ecosystem","start":433,"end":442,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"degradation","start":443,"end":454,"id":81,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":454,"end":455,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"especially","start":456,"end":466,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"across","start":46

This continent will be home to a quarter of the world\u2019s population in little more than a generation and many areas have already degraded into semi-barren drylands. \u201cInitiatives like TREES are playing an important role in reversing decades of ecosystem degradation, especially across the Sahel, pushing back desertification, increasing climate resilience and improving the wellbeing of farmers and their communities,\u201d Andersen said in announcing the World Restoration Flagship. While there is no doubt about the need for reforestation, there are historical reasons to be sceptical about the effectiveness of such programmes. Expectations are often too high. A 2019 study suggesting the climate crisis could be significantly eased by planting a trillion trees across the world was later debunked as unrealistic because there was not enough suitable land. Many governments have launched mass tree-planting campaigns, but after the initial day or two of publicity, there is rarely sufficient irrigation, protection and other follow-up to ensure seeds and saplings grow into trunks and branches. Often such national initiatives are little more than greenwashing distractions from far greater forest destruction elsewhere. Kenya, for example, has launched numerous tree-planting initiatives in recent decades, including the Million Operation Gavisha in 1977, the Trees Campaign in 2006, the Greening Kenya Initiative in 2010 and the Accelerated National Tree Growing Campaign 2022, yet overall, it has lost 11% of its tree cover since 2000. The situation has stabilised somewhat in the past two years under the current president, William Ruto, who has declared an annual tree-planting holiday and set a national target to plant 15bn trees and raise tree cover to 30% by 2032.\n'''"],"response":["project: TREES, World Restoration Flagship, Million Operation Gavisha, Trees Campaign, Greening Kenya Initiative, Accelerated National Tree Growing Campaign\ninitiative: restoration, reversing decades of ecosystem degradation, pushing back desertification, increasing climate resilience, improving the wellbeing of farmers and their communities, mass tree-planting campaigns\npolicy: \ntechnology: reforestation, irrigation, protection, tree-planting initiatives"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772296,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"Children with more green space near their homes have significantly stronger bones, a study has found, potentially leading to lifelong health benefits. Scientists found that the children living in places with 20-25% more natural areas had increased bone strength that was equivalent to half a year\u2019s natural growth. The study, the first of its kind, also found that the risk of having very low bone density was about 65% lower for these children. Bone strength grows in childhood and adolescence, before plateauing until about the age of 50 and then declining. Increasing the size and accessibility of green spaces for children could therefore prevent fractures and osteoporosis in older people, the researchers said. The link between green spaces and stronger bones is likely to result from higher levels of physical activity in children who live near parks, as this spurs bone growth. The connection was strongest for green spaces with trees, which the scientists said may be because these were more attractive places to visit. \u201cThe stronger the bone mass is during childhood, the more capacity you have for later in life,\u201d said Prof Tim Nawrot, at Hasselt University in Belgium, who was part of the study team with Dr Hanne Sleurs and others. \u201cSo the real public health message from this study is that urban planners can make stronger bones of children, and that has long-lasting consequences.\u201d Previous research has found greater access to green spaces increases physical activity in

Scientists found that the children living in places with 20-25% more natural areas had increased bone strength that was equivalent to half a year\u2019s natural growth. The study, the first of its kind, also found that the risk of having very low bone density was about 65% lower for these children. Bone strength grows in childhood and adolescence, before plateauing until about the age of 50 and then declining. Increasing the size and accessibility of green spaces for children could therefore prevent fractures and osteoporosis in older people, the researchers said. The link between green spaces and stronger bones is likely to result from higher levels of physical activity in children who live near parks, as this spurs bone growth. The connection was strongest for green spaces with trees, which the scientists said may be because these were more attractive places to visit. \u201cThe stronger the bone mass is during childhood, the more capacity you have for later in life,\u201d said Prof Tim Nawrot, at Hasselt University in Belgium, who was part of the study team with Dr Hanne Sleurs and others. \u201cSo the real public health message from this study is that urban planners can make stronger bones of children, and that has long-lasting consequences.\u201d Previous research has found greater access to green spaces increases physical activity in children.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: increasing the size and accessibility of green spaces for children, prevent fractures and osteoporosis in older people\npolicy: \ntechnology: green spaces, trees"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772306,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"Scientists are starting to count the health cost of heating our homes with wood. One study, in Canberra in Australia, has found that deaths from everyday exposure to smoke from wood burners is comparable with those during the unprecedented \u201cblack summer\u201d bushfires of 2019/2020. Prof Sotiris Vardoulakis, part of the research team and director of the Healthy Environments and Lives (Heal) National Research Network, described winter in the city: \u201cWhen I take my two boys to play basketball outdoors in winter, or when we walk the dog before dinner, there is always a smell of wood smoke in the air.\u201d Vardoulakis and his team found that wood-heating was causing up to a quarter of the particle pollution in Canberra. Combining this information on the health harm from air pollution, they estimated that between 17 and 63 deaths were attributable annually to wood smoke in the Australian Capital Territory, which has a population of about 450,000. This shortening of life means an annual loss of A$92m to A$333m (\u00a348m to \u00a3173m) to Australian society. The health impact of this regular winter burning was comparable to the deaths during the 2019-2020 \u201cblack summer\u201d bushfires from smoke. Vardoulakis said: \u201cCanberra suffers from winter pollution, largely due to wood-heaters. There are many complaints from families with asthma, but also from people without chronic health conditions. They feel

Prof Sotiris Vardoulakis, part of the research team and director of the Healthy Environments and Lives (Heal) National Research Network, described winter in the city: \u201cWhen I take my two boys to play basketball outdoors in winter, or when we walk the dog before dinner, there is always a smell of wood smoke in the air.\u201d Vardoulakis and his team found that wood-heating was causing up to a quarter of the particle pollution in Canberra. Combining this information on the health harm from air pollution, they estimated that between 17 and 63 deaths were attributable annually to wood smoke in the Australian Capital Territory, which has a population of about 450,000. This shortening of life means an annual loss of A$92m to A$333m (\u00a348m to \u00a3173m) to Australian society. The health impact of this regular winter burning was comparable to the deaths during the 2019-2020 \u201cblack summer\u201d bushfires from smoke. Vardoulakis said: \u201cCanberra suffers from winter pollution, largely due to wood-heaters. There are many complaints from families with asthma, but also from people without chronic health conditions. They feel hopeless.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: wood burners, particle pollution, air pollution, wood smoke, wood-heating"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772317,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"A South Fulham east neighbourhood project was made permanent in December 2021. The council published a report on Friday proposing a similar trial scheme introduced in February 2023, known as the South Fulham west project, be made permanent. Average traffic flows lower on residential roads and some main arterial roads between March 2022, before the trial, and March 2023 during it. The market research agency Opinium polled residents in the trial area: 59% supported reducing out-of-borough traffic using neighbourhood streets as cut-throughs. The polling firm also conducted an online consultation of residents and businesses in the borough: 52% of respondents supported the principle of reducing out-of-borough traffic using neighbourhood streets as cut-throughs, and 59% of businesses were opposed. Hands, a trade minister and minister for London, said his own survey published last year found 70% of residents do not support the schemes. He said he had been contacted by many businesses and residents about the impact on the area. \u201cBusinesses say no one want to come to them any more because they spend too long in traffic.\u201d Hands said he did not own a car and used public transport in the borough, but considered the scheme was ill-thought out and the council should \u201cgo back to the drawing board\u201d. He said he doubted whether people would vote at the general election on their views on traffic schemes.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/25/support-for-clean-air-traffic-scheme-in-chelsea-plunges-tory-mp-into-row_1","publication_date":"2024-02-25T08:00:52Z"},"_input_hash":1247497121,"_task_hash":934587717,"tokens":[{"text":"A","start":0,"end":1,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"South","start":2,"end":7,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"Fulham","start":8,"end":14,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"east","start":15,"end":19,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"neighbourhood","start":20,"end":33,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"project","start":34,"end":41,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"was","start":42,"end":45,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"made","start":46,"end":50,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"permanent","start":51,"end":60,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":61,"end":63,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"December","start":64,"end":72,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"2021","start":73,"end":77,"id":11,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":77,"end":78,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"The","start":79,"end":82,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"council","start":83,"end":90,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"published","start":91,"end":100,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":101,"end":102,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"report","start":103,"end":109,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":110,"end":112,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"Friday","start":113,"end":119,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"proposing","start":120,"end":129,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":130,"end":131,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"similar","start":132,"end":139,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"trial","start":140,"end":145,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"scheme","start":146,"end":152,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"introduced","start":153,"end":163,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":164,"end":166,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"February","start":167,"end":175,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"2023","start":176,"end":180,"id":28,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":180,"end":181,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"known","start":182,"end":187,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":188,"end":190,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":191,"end":194,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"South","start":195,"end":200,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"Fulham","start":201,"end":207,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"west","start":208,"end":212,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"project","start":213,"end":220,"id":36,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":220,"end":221,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":222,"end":224,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"made","start":225,"end":229,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"permanent","start":230,"end":239,"id":40,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":239,"end":240,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"Average","start":241,"end":248,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"traffic","start":249,"end":256,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"flows","start":257,"end":262,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"lower","start":263,"end":268,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":269,"end":271,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"residential","start":272,"end":283,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"roads","start":284,"end":289,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":290,"end":293,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"some","start":294,"end":298,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"main","start":299,"end":303,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"arterial","start":304,"end":312,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"roads","start":313,"end":318,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"between","start":319,"end":326,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"March","start":327,"end":332,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"2022","start":333,"end":337,"id":56,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":337,"end":338,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"before","start":339,"end":345,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":346,"end":349,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"trial","start":350,"end":355,"id":60,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":355,"end":356,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":357,"end":360,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"March","start":361,"end":366,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"2023","start":367,"end":371,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"during","start":372,"end":378,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":379,"end":381,"id":66,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":381,"end":382,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"The","start":383,"end":386,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"market","start":387,"end":393,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"research","start":394,"end":402,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"agency","start":403,"end":409,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"Opinium","start":410,"end":417,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"polled","start":418,"end":424,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"residents","start":425,"end":434,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":435,"end":437,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":438,"end":441,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"trial","start":442,"end":447,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"area","start":448,"end":452,"id":78,"ws":false},{"text":":","start":452,"end":453,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"59","start":454,"end":456,"id":80,"ws":false},{"text":"%","start":456,"end":457,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"supported","start":458,"end":467,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"reducing","start":468,"end":476,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"out","start":477,"end":480,"id":8

Average traffic flows lower on residential roads and some main arterial roads between March 2022, before the trial, and March 2023 during it. The market research agency Opinium polled residents in the trial area: 59% supported reducing out-of-borough traffic using neighbourhood streets as cut-throughs. The polling firm also conducted an online consultation of residents and businesses in the borough: 52% of respondents supported the principle of reducing out-of-borough traffic using neighbourhood streets as cut-throughs, and 59% of businesses were opposed. Hands, a trade minister and minister for London, said his own survey published last year found 70% of residents do not support the schemes. He said he had been contacted by many businesses and residents about the impact on the area. \u201cBusinesses say no one want to come to them any more because they spend too long in traffic.\u201d Hands said he did not own a car and used public transport in the borough, but considered the scheme was ill-thought out and the council should \u201cgo back to the drawing board\u201d.

This year is the worst I can remember. Golf courses are classic breeding grounds \u2013 toads love it.\u201d For the third year running, Australians living across the cane toad\u2019s territory are being asked to be a part of the Great Cane Toad Bust run by the not-for-profit community environment group Watergum. Gloves, bucket and a torch are the basic kit. At last year\u2019s Great Cane Toad Bust, Middap and his mates took out the unofficial top ranking, grabbing more than 2,700 toads from the estate\u2019s golf course and back yards. This year\u2019s event \u2013 to be held from 13 to 21 January \u2013 follows months of weather that has been great for cane toads. Dr Jodi Rowley, a frog biologist at the Australian Museum and the University of New South Wales, says the warm and wet conditions as well as flooding in recent months are perfect conditions for all amphibians \u2013 including cane toads.

{"text":"A frog species that is in a \u201cperilous state\u201d due to an infectious disease has been successfully bred at a wildlife park in Oxfordshire. Keepers at the Cotswold wildlife park in Burford have again bred the near-threatened cinnamon frog, four years after it became only the second zoological collection in Europe to breed the species. Reptile keepers have paid homage to the name and called the froglets after different coloured spices including paprika, cayenne, saffron, chipotle and chilli, and they are being looked after in a specialist amphibian breeding room. Jamie Craig, general manager of Cotswold wildlife park, said the species is in a \u201cperilous state\u201d due to the chytrid fungus, an infectious disease in frogs. He said: \u201cOur dedicated reptile team have been working hard to perfect breeding techniques in our Amphibian Room. \u201cMany frog species have incredibly specific requirements, and it is a testament to their hard work that they have now managed to replicate our previous success with the cinnamon frogs. \u201cWith the perilous state of many amphibian species in the world due to the Chytrid fungus, any expertise garnered from the captive populations may well be important tools for the future of these fascinating creatures.\u201d Only five other zoos in Europe keep the species with one other successfully breeding the frogs in the last 12 months, according to the wildlife park. The amphibians, known for their distinctive reddish-brown colour, similar to cinnamon, and black-and-white spots across their bodies, are native to parts of south-east Asia including Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Sumatra.

Keepers at the Cotswold wildlife park in Burford have again bred the near-threatened cinnamon frog, four years after it became only the second zoological collection in Europe to breed the species. Reptile keepers have paid homage to the name and called the froglets after different coloured spices including paprika, cayenne, saffron, chipotle and chilli, and they are being looked after in a specialist amphibian breeding room. Jamie Craig, general manager of Cotswold wildlife park, said the species is in a \u201cperilous state\u201d due to the chytrid fungus, an infectious disease in frogs.

Samples of plants close to sites where birds have been found are also being checked. Researchers have ruled out any infectious disease and there is no evidence so far that chemicals such as pesticides are to blame. Phalen says the working hypothesis is that the birds are being affected by a toxin such as a bacteria or fungi, which could be growing on the plants they feed on. Rainbow lorikeets feed on nectar, pollen and native fruits. But narrowing down what they are eating will be difficult.

country.","meta":{"id":"environment/2023/dec/21/prosanta-chakrabarty-i-discovered-cavefish-big-sickness-aoe_1","publication_date":"2023-12-21T10:00:22Z"},"_input_hash":-1910555604,"_task_hash":84056204,"tokens":[{"text":"They","start":0,"end":4,"id":0,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019re","start":4,"end":7,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"often","start":8,"end":13,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"only","start":14,"end":18,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"three","start":19,"end":24,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"inches","start":25,"end":31,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"long","start":32,"end":36,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"so","start":37,"end":39,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":40,"end":42,"id":8,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":42,"end":44,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"not","start":45,"end":48,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":49,"end":53,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"scary","start":54,"end":59,"id":12,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":59,"end":60,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"But","start":61,"end":64,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":65,"end":67,"id":15,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":67,"end":69,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":70,"end":71,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"privilege","start":72,"end":81,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"seeing","start":82,"end":88,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"wildlife","start":89,"end":97,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"coming","start":98,"end":104,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"towards","start":105,"end":112,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"you","start":113,"end":116,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"\u2013","start":117,"end":118,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":119,"end":123,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"rarely","start":124,"end":130,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"happens","start":131,"end":138,"id":27,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":138,"end":139,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"I","start":140,"end":141,"id":29,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019m","start":141,"end":143,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":144,"end":145,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"systematist","start":146,"end":157,"id":32,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":157,"end":158,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"which","start":159,"end":164,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":165,"end":167,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"someone","start":168,"end":175,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"who","start":176,"end":179,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"studies","start":180,"end":187,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":188,"end":191,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"tree","start":192,"end":196,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":197,"end":199,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"life","start":200,"end":204,"id":42,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":204,"end":205,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"figuring","start":206,"end":214,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"out","start":215,"end":218,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"who","start":219,"end":222,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":223,"end":225,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"related","start":226,"end":233,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":234,"end":236,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"who","start":237,"end":240,"id":50,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":240,"end":241,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"often","start":242,"end":247,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":248,"end":252,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"DNA","start":253,"end":256,"id":54,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":256,"end":257,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"Sometimes","start":258,"end":267,"id":56,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":267,"end":268,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"we","start":269,"end":271,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"add","start":272,"end":275,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"new","start":276,"end":279,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"branches","start":280,"end":288,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":289,"end":291,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":292,"end":295,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"tree","start":296,"end":300,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":301,"end":303,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"discovering","start":304,"end":315,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"species","start":316,"end":323,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"new","start":324,"end":327,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":328,"end":330,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"science","start":331,"end":338,"id":70,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":338,"end":339,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"I","start":340,"end":341,"id":72,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019ve","start":341,"end":344,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"described","start":345,"end":354,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"15","start":355,"end":357,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"species","start":358,"end":365,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":366,"end":368,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"fish","start":369,"end":373,"id":78,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":373,"end":374,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"several","start":375,"end":382,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":383,"end":385,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"them","start":386,"end":390,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"cavefish","start":391,"end":399,"id":83,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":399,"end":400,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"My","start":401,"end":403,"id":85,"ws":tr

{"text":"The granman recounts the story of how an 18th-century ancestor named Ma Paanza hid rice grains in her hair and brought them to the newly founded communities in the jungle. The Saamaka still grow a strain of rice called Ma Paanza. \u201c[Rice] is easy to cultivate. It was an ideal food for us then and until now,\u201d Aboikoni says. Now, centuries after escaping from the plantations, the Saamaka find their ancestral lands facing new threats, this time from climate breakdown. In 2022, Suriname bore the brunt of heavy rainfall due to the climate crisis and La Ni\u00f1a weather patterns, resulting in widespread flooding in the interior. In response to the mounting pressure from extreme rainfall on the Brokopondo reservoir in the middle of the country, the state-owned oil and gas company, Staatsolie, opened the sluices of the Afobaka dam, designed to supply electricity to the now-defunct industrial aluminium smelters of the US multinational Alcoa.

In response to the mounting pressure from extreme rainfall on the Brokopondo reservoir in the middle of the country, the state-owned oil and gas company, Staatsolie, opened the sluices of the Afobaka dam, designed to supply electricity to the now-defunct industrial aluminium smelters of the US multinational Alcoa.

{"text":"With a power plant humming away nearby, my first visit to the heart of Kenya\u2019s geothermal power generation turns out to be a lesson on what is going on below our feet. According to the Geological Society, the Somalian and Nubian tectonic plates pulled away in opposite directions about 25m years ago, with the surface between the two fault lines sinking and bringing magmatic fluids closer to Earth\u2019s surface and creating the famous rift, a vast valley that stretches 6,400km from Jordan to Mozambique. Under the valley, water percolates easily and comes into contact with hot rocks found 1-3km beneath the surface, creating a mix of superheated water and steam at 75% and 25% respectively, with temperatures averaging 300C (572F) and pressures of 1,000 PSI. These are, it turns out, the perfect conditions for generating geothermal energy. \u201cThis is the steam we are tapping to run the turbines that generate electricity. It is rough down there, and that is where we go,\u201d says Mangi. \u201cA dangerous but necessary mission.\u201d Mangi has observed the behaviour of the valley for 27 years and knows exactly where to drill a well that will yield geothermal power. \u201cKenya has developed the capacity for precision geoscientific studies that help us to identify potential areas to drill. Exploration and drilling are cost-intensive endeavours and investors don\u2019t want to go to a greenfield without confirmed viable resources,\u201d he

According to the Geological Society, the Somalian and Nubian tectonic plates pulled away in opposite directions about 25m years ago, with the surface between the two fault lines sinking and bringing magmatic fluids closer to Earth\u2019s surface and creating the famous rift, a vast valley that stretches 6,400km from Jordan to Mozambique. Under the valley, water percolates easily and comes into contact with hot rocks found 1-3km beneath the surface, creating a mix of superheated water and steam at 75% and 25% respectively, with temperatures averaging 300C (572F) and pressures of 1,000 PSI. These are, it turns out, the perfect conditions for generating geothermal energy. \u201cThis is the steam we are tapping to run the turbines that generate electricity. It is rough down there, and that is where we go,\u201d says Mangi. \u201cA dangerous but necessary mission.\u201d Mangi has observed the behaviour of the valley for 27 years and knows exactly where to drill a well that will yield geothermal power. \u201cKenya has developed the capacity for precision geoscientific studies that help us to identify potential areas to drill. Exploration and drilling are cost-intensive endeavours and investors don\u2019t want to go to a greenfield without confirmed viable resources,\u201d he says.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: geothermal energy, tectonic plates, rift, magmatic fluids, hot rocks, steam, turbines"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772440,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

Others are rethinking glass towers entirely, experimenting with exteriors that use wood, concrete or steel rods. Blurring lines between the indoors and outdoors, some architects are creating green roofs and facades, inviting birds to nest within the building. \u201cMany people think about bird-friendly design as yet another limitation on buildings, yet another requirement,\u201d said Dan Piselli, director of sustainability at the New York-based architecture firm FXCollaborative. \u201cBut there are so many design-forward buildings that perfectly exemplify that this doesn\u2019t have to limit your design, your freedom.\u201d How modern buildings put birds in danger For Deborah Laurel, principal in the firm Prendergast Laurel Architects, the realization came a couple of decades ago.

{"text":"Flexible, thin solar cells that are lightweight and portable may be a step closer to reality after Australian researchers claimed a new record for the amount of sunlight they can capture and turn into energy. While traditional solar panels are rigid and heavy, the lightweight solar cells are made by printing ink on to thin plastic films. \u201cIt\u2019s the best demonstration that this is a viable method of making the solar cells,\u201d said CSIRO\u2019s renewable energy systems group leader, Dr Anthony Chesman. The scientists, working in collaboration with researchers from four universities, claimed an efficiency record for fully roll-to-roll printed cells, in which all of the layers of the product were made using printing methods. For a small-scale device they achieved efficiency of 15.5% and for a larger device measuring 50cm sq they achieved efficiency of 11%. The results of the research have been published in the journal Nature Communications. Lead author and CSIRO\u2019s principal research scientist, Dr Doojin Vak, said the efficiencies were made possible by integrating machine learning into the production process. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cWe developed a system for rapidly producing and testing over 10,000 solar cells a day \u2013 something that would have been impossible to do manually,\u201d he said. Vak said the team\u2019s research had also removed the need for some expensive materials in production of the cells, such as gold, by using specialised carbon inks that could reduce production costs. The emerging technology still trails the efficiency of conventional silicon solar panels and its potential use in the market is still some years away.","meta":{"id":"australia-news/2024/mar/12/csiro-claims-new-record-for-energy-efficiency-in-lightweight-printed-solar-cells_0","publication_date":"2024-03-12T09:56:22Z"},"_input_hash":-177770985,"_task_hash":1122926665,"tokens":[{"text":"Flexible","start":0,"end":8,"id":0,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":8,"end":9,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"thin","start":10,"end":14,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"solar","start":15,"end":20,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"cells","start":21,"end":26,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":27,"end":31,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":32,"end":35,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"lightweight","start":36,"end":47,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":48,"end":51,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"portable","start":52,"end":60,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"may","start":61,"end":64,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":65,"end":67,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":68,"end":69,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"step","start":70,"end":74,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"closer","start":75,"end":81,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":82,"end":84,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"reality","start":85,"end":92,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"after","start":93,"end":98,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"Australian","start":99,"end":109,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"researchers","start":110,"end":121,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"claimed","start":122,"end":129,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":130,"end":131,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"new","start":132,"end":135,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"record","start":136,"end":142,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":143,"end":146,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":147,"end":150,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"amount","start":151,"end":157,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":158,"end":160,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"sunlight","start":161,"end":169,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"they","start":170,"end":174,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"can","start":175,"end":178,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"capture","start":179,"end":186,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":187,"end":190,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"turn","start":191,"end":195,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"into","start":196,"end":200,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"energy","start":201,"end":207,"id":35,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":207,"end":208,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"While","start":209,"end":214,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"traditional","start":215,"end":226,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"solar","start":227,"end":232,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"panels","start":233,"end":239,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":240,"end":243,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"rigid","start":244,"end":249,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":250,"end":253,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"heavy","start":254,"end":259,"id":44,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":259,"end":260,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":261,"end":264,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"lightweight","start":265,"end":276,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"solar","start":277,"end":282,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"cells","start":283,"end":288,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":289,"end":292,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"made","start":293,"end":297,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":298,"end":300,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"printing","start":301,"end":309,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"ink","start":310,"end":313,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":314,"end":316,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":317,"end":319,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"thin","start":320,"end":324,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"plastic","start":325,"end":332,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"films","start":333,"end":338,"id":59,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":338,"end":339,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"\u201c","start":340,"end":341,"id":61,"ws":false},{"text":"It","start":341,"end":343,"id":62,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":343,"end":345,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":346,"end":349,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"best","start":350,"end":354,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"demonstration","start":355,"end":368,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":369,"end":373,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"this","start":374,"end":378,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":379,"end":381,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":382,"end":383,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"viable","start":384,"end":390,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"method","start":391,"end":397,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":398,"end":400,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"making","start":401,"end":407,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":408,"end":411,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"solar","start":412,"end":417,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"cells","start":418,"end":423,"id":77,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":423,"end":424,"id":78,"ws":false},{"text":"\u201d","start":424,"end":425,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"said","start":426,"end":430,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"CSIRO","start":431,"end":436,"id":81,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":436,"end":438,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"renewable","start":439,"end":448,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"energy","start":449,"end":455,"id":84

While traditional solar panels are rigid and heavy, the lightweight solar cells are made by printing ink on to thin plastic films. \u201cIt\u2019s the best demonstration that this is a viable method of making the solar cells,\u201d said CSIRO\u2019s renewable energy systems group leader, Dr Anthony Chesman. The scientists, working in collaboration with researchers from four universities, claimed an efficiency record for fully roll-to-roll printed cells, in which all of the layers of the product were made using printing methods. For a small-scale device they achieved efficiency of 15.5% and for a larger device measuring 50cm sq they achieved efficiency of 11%. The results of the research have been published in the journal Nature Communications. Lead author and CSIRO\u2019s principal research scientist, Dr Doojin Vak, said the efficiencies were made possible by integrating machine learning into the production process. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cWe developed a system for rapidly producing and testing over 10,000 solar cells a day \u2013 something that would have been impossible to do manually,\u201d he said. Vak said the team\u2019s research had also removed the need for some expensive materials in production of the cells, such as gold, by using specialised carbon inks that could reduce production costs. The emerging technology still trails the efficiency of conventional silicon solar panels and its potential use in the market is still some years away.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: thin solar cells, lightweight solar cells, printing ink, thin plastic films, machine learning, carbon inks\nmethod: roll-to-roll printing, integrating machine learning, using carbon inks"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772478,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

majority.\u201d","meta":{"id":"politics/2024/feb/13/young-climate-activists-labour-candidate-selections-green-new-deal-rising_1","publication_date":"2024-02-13T15:22:06Z"},"_input_hash":991464076,"_task_hash":-1939926748,"tokens":[{"text":"\u201c","start":0,"end":1,"id":0,"ws":false},{"text":"Our","start":1,"end":4,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"organising","start":5,"end":15,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"programmes","start":16,"end":26,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":27,"end":30,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"getting","start":31,"end":38,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"ready","start":39,"end":44,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":45,"end":47,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"absorb","start":48,"end":54,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"thousands","start":55,"end":64,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":65,"end":67,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"young","start":68,"end":73,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"people","start":74,"end":80,"id":12,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":80,"end":81,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":82,"end":85,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"we","start":86,"end":88,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"said","start":89,"end":93,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":94,"end":96,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"Jamie","start":97,"end":102,"id":18,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":102,"end":104,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"instance","start":105,"end":113,"id":20,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":113,"end":114,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":115,"end":117,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":118,"end":122,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"campaign","start":123,"end":131,"id":24,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":131,"end":132,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"we","start":133,"end":135,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":136,"end":139,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"going","start":140,"end":145,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":146,"end":148,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"need","start":149,"end":153,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":154,"end":156,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"turn","start":157,"end":161,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"out","start":162,"end":165,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"60,000","start":166,"end":172,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"votes","start":173,"end":178,"id":35,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":178,"end":179,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"\u201c","start":180,"end":181,"id":37,"ws":false},{"text":"We","start":181,"end":183,"id":38,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019re","start":183,"end":186,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"talking","start":187,"end":194,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"big","start":195,"end":198,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"numbers","start":199,"end":206,"id":42,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":206,"end":207,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"but","start":208,"end":211,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"we","start":212,"end":214,"id":45,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019ve","start":214,"end":217,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"been","start":218,"end":222,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"working","start":223,"end":230,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":231,"end":233,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"this","start":234,"end":238,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":239,"end":242,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"building","start":243,"end":251,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":252,"end":255,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"sort","start":256,"end":260,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":261,"end":263,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"infrastructure","start":264,"end":278,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":279,"end":281,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":282,"end":284,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"able","start":285,"end":289,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":290,"end":292,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"scale","start":293,"end":298,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":299,"end":302,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":303,"end":306,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"last","start":307,"end":311,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"18","start":312,"end":314,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"months","start":315,"end":321,"id":66,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":321,"end":322,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"So","start":323,"end":325,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"we","start":326,"end":328,"id":69,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019re","start":328,"end":331,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"ready","start":332,"end":337,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":338,"end":340,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"take","start":341,"end":345,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":346,"end":348,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"young","start":349,"end":354,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"people","start":355,"end":361,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"up","start":362,"end":364,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":365,"end":368,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"down","start":369,"end":373,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":374,"end":377,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"country","start":378,"end":385,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":386,"end":388,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"take","start":389,"end":393,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"those","start":394,"end":399,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"roles","start":400,"end

{"text":"Serious flooding has hit parts of Saudi Arabia after a red rainfall warning was issued at the end of last week by the National Centre for Meteorology. The areas most seriously affected were in the north, specifically the provinces of Hail and al-Qassim and the far north of Ash Sharqiyah. High rainfall totals, hailstorms and lightning were expected to come with heavy showers that moved in from the west. Typically, these parts of Saudi Arabia receive about 10-15mm of rainfall in December, with this falling across three to six days of the month. However, some meteorological models were suggesting rainfall totals of 20-50mm in places by the time the warning ended during the early hours of Saturday night. So far there have been reports of flooding and large quantities of hail covering the streets in the city of Buraydah, al-Qassim. While exact measurements have been difficult to obtain, there has been video footage of cars either driving through flood waters or becoming stranded in large quantities of hail once the flood water receded. Temperatures across large swathes of Canada will continue to remain at least 5C above the average through this week. In some areas there will be an extreme difference in temperature from the seasonal norm, notably for parts of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario, where daytime maximums could be 20C higher than the average. For context, Thompson in north-central Manitoba has a daily mean temperature of -20.6C in December, but is expected to reach -2C early this

The areas most seriously affected were in the north, specifically the provinces of Hail and al-Qassim and the far north of Ash Sharqiyah. High rainfall totals, hailstorms and lightning were expected to come with heavy showers that moved in from the west. Typically, these parts of Saudi Arabia receive about 10-15mm of rainfall in December, with this falling across three to six days of the month. However, some meteorological models were suggesting rainfall totals of 20-50mm in places by the time the warning ended during the early hours of Saturday night. So far there have been reports of flooding and large quantities of hail covering the streets in the city of Buraydah, al-Qassim. While exact measurements have been difficult to obtain, there has been video footage of cars either driving through flood waters or becoming stranded in large quantities of hail once the flood water receded. Temperatures across large swathes of Canada will continue to remain at least 5C above the average through this week. In some areas there will be an extreme difference in temperature from the seasonal norm, notably for parts of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario, where daytime maximums could be 20C higher than the average. For context, Thompson in north-central Manitoba has a daily mean temperature of -20.6C in December, but is expected to reach -2C early this week.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: red rainfall warning, meteorological models, hailstorms, lightning, flood waters, meteorological models, video footage, flood waters, hail"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1710772504,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"My interest in fossils began at the age of 10 in my back garden in Glastonbury, Somerset, where I discovered ammonites. With hindsight, it wasn\u2019t beauty that drew me to them, but the magic of discovery. I was drawn in by their sheer age, and the unfathomable nature of the distant past. After my degree in natural sciences in 1965 I wanted to go as far away as I could, so I applied to teach biology in Ghana. It was a fantastic period of my life where I discovered a lot more than rocks in the back garden. After eight years I came back to the UK, and spent much of the next decades raising four children. At times it was a hard life and I put all my dreams of research on hold. I thought, I\u2019ll enjoy fossiling when I retire at 60 \u2013 but I didn\u2019t plan to get so serious about it. I had a vague interest in a local site in Weymouth on the Jurassic Coast. Quickly I could see it was a treasure trove, yet nobody was researching it.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/07/i-discovered-thousands-of-fossils-after-retiring-now-im-nearly-80-and-still-going-strong-aoe_0","publication_date":"2024-03-07T10:43:25Z"},"_input_hash":-730614096,"_task_hash":-1056697234,"tokens":[{"text":"My","start":0,"end":2,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"interest","start":3,"end":11,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":12,"end":14,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"fossils","start":15,"end":22,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"began","start":23,"end":28,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"at","start":29,"end":31,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":32,"end":35,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"age","start":36,"end":39,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":40,"end":42,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"10","start":43,"end":45,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":46,"end":48,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"my","start":49,"end":51,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"back","start":52,"end":56,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"garden","start":57,"end":63,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":64,"end":66,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"Glastonbury","start":67,"end":78,"id":15,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":78,"end":79,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"Somerset","start":80,"end":88,"id":17,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":88,"end":89,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"where","start":90,"end":95,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"I","start":96,"end":97,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"discovered","start":98,"end":108,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"ammonites","start":109,"end":118,"id":22,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":118,"end":119,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"With","start":120,"end":124,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"hindsight","start":125,"end":134,"id":25,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":134,"end":135,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":136,"end":138,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"was","start":139,"end":142,"id":28,"ws":false},{"text":"n\u2019t","start":142,"end":145,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"beauty","start":146,"end":152,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":153,"end":157,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"drew","start":158,"end":162,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"me","start":163,"end":165,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":166,"end":168,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"them","start":169,"end":173,"id":35,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":173,"end":174,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"but","start":175,"end":178,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":179,"end":182,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"magic","start":183,"end":188,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":189,"end":191,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"discovery","start":192,"end":201,"id":41,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":201,"end":202,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"I","start":203,"end":204,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"was","start":205,"end":208,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"drawn","start":209,"end":214,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":215,"end":217,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":218,"end":220,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"their","start":221,"end":226,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"sheer","start":227,"end":232,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"age","start":233,"end":236,"id":50,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":236,"end":237,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":238,"end":241,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":242,"end":245,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"unfathomable","start":246,"end":258,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"nature","start":259,"end":265,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":266,"end":268,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":269,"end":272,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"distant","start":273,"end":280,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"past","start":281,"end":285,"id":59,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":285,"end":286,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"After","start":287,"end":292,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"my","start":293,"end":295,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"degree","start":296,"end":302,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":303,"end":305,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"natural","start":306,"end":313,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"sciences","start":314,"end":322,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":323,"end":325,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"1965","start":326,"end":330,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"I","start":331,"end":332,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"wanted","start":333,"end":339,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":340,"end":342,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"go","start":343,"end":345,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":346,"end":348,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"far","start":349,"end":352,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"away","start":353,"end":357,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":358,"end":360,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"I","start":361,"end":362,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"could","start":363,"end":368,"id":78,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":368,"end":369,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"so","start":370,"end":372,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"I","start":373,"end":374,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"applied","start":375,"end":382,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":383,"end":385,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"teach","start":386,"end":391,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"biology","start":392,"end":399,"id":85,"ws":true},{"t

After my degree in natural sciences in 1965 I wanted to go as far away as I could, so I applied to teach biology in Ghana. It was a fantastic period of my life where I discovered a lot more than rocks in the back garden. After eight years I came back to the UK, and spent much of the next decades raising four children. At times it was a hard life and I put all my dreams of research on hold. I thought, I\u2019ll enjoy fossiling when I retire at 60 \u2013 but I didn\u2019t plan to get so serious about it. I had a vague interest in a local site in Weymouth on the Jurassic Coast.

{"text":"A seasoned farmer told me recently that he doesn\u2019t truly consider winter to have begun until late December at least. Though wary of his predisposition to proclaim, usually with contrasuggestible intent, I\u2019m beginning to think he has a point. The monotony of mild, wet conditions during the summer, through the autumn and on into this new year have blurred three seasons into one. Our hedges remain uncut because the ground is inaccessible and I hear anecdotes of winter wheat sown not twice but three times now due to still-active slugs. Farmers are always responding to weather and, of course, occasionally it works to our advantage. In late November, rather than begin supplementary feeding, I negotiated some leased grazing. At \u00a33.50 a day as opposed to \u00a33.50 for a small bale of hay, the economics and convenience were a godsend. But the order of this current adjustment feels unprecedented. The National Trust\u2019s annual review of 2023, published just after Christmas, highlighted the threat to nature of rising temperatures, and this has seemingly been borne out by the Animal and Plant Health Agency\u2019s ongoing text alerts warning farmers to remain vigilant following an outbreak of bluetongue in Kent. This virus, affecting cattle and sheep, is transmitted by those warm-weather pests,

Our hedges remain uncut because the ground is inaccessible and I hear anecdotes of winter wheat sown not twice but three times now due to still-active slugs.

At \u00a33.50 a day as opposed to \u00a33.50 for a small bale of hay, the economics and convenience were a godsend. But the order of this current adjustment feels unprecedented. The National Trust\u2019s annual review of 2023, published just after Christmas, highlighted the threat to nature of rising temperatures, and this has seemingly been borne out by the Animal and Plant Health Agency\u2019s ongoing text alerts warning farmers to remain vigilant following an outbreak of bluetongue in Kent.

{"text":"The mother of a nine-year-old girl who became the first person in the UK to have air pollution cited on their death certificate has launched a high court claim against the government. Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah is suing three government departments for compensation for personal injury arising from the illness and premature death of her daughter Ella. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Transport and the Department of Health and Social Care have all been named as defendants in the claim. Her lawyers said she hoped the action would further her broader campaign to establish the \u201cright to clean air\u201d. Ella Kissi-Debrah, from south-east London, had a fatal asthma attack in 2013 after being exposed to excessive air pollution. In an inquest in 2020, a coroner ruled that air pollution had \u201cmade a material contribution\u201d to her death. Ravi Mehta, the barrister instructed by Hodge Jones &amp; Allen, the law firm representing the family, said in written arguments presented to the court: \u201cWhile this claim does include a claim for damages, it is not about money. Rather, the focus of the claim is about seeking vindication for the death of Ella, a child.\u201d Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah spent years investigating potential links between Ella\u2019s death and air pollution, particularly unlawful levels of nitrogen dioxide caused by traffic. The family lived approximately 25 metres from the busy South Circular and Ella regularly walked by it on her way to and from

Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah is suing three government departments for compensation for personal injury arising from the illness and premature death of her daughter Ella. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Transport and the Department of Health and Social Care have all been named as defendants in the claim. Her lawyers said she hoped the action would further her broader campaign to establish the \u201cright to clean air\u201d. Ella Kissi-Debrah, from south-east London, had a fatal asthma attack in 2013 after being exposed to excessive air pollution. In an inquest in 2020, a coroner ruled that air pollution had \u201cmade a material contribution\u201d to her death. Ravi Mehta, the barrister instructed by Hodge Jones &amp; Allen, the law firm representing the family, said in written arguments presented to the court: \u201cWhile this claim does include a claim for damages, it is not about money. Rather, the focus of the claim is about seeking vindication for the death of Ella, a child.\u201d Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah spent years investigating potential links between Ella\u2019s death and air pollution, particularly unlawful levels of nitrogen dioxide caused by traffic. The family lived approximately 25 metres from the busy South Circular and Ella regularly walked by it on her way to and from school.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: establish the \u201cright to clean air\npolicy: \ntechnology: air pollution, nitrogen dioxide, traffic"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1710772581,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"BNG is regulated by several bodies, including local authorities and government agencies. This is seen a strength of the scheme, as it avoids the problem of \u201cmarking your own homework\u201d associated with voluntary markets. However, regulators lack the staff to check the pledged habitat benefits actually materialise. Zu Ermgassen was part of a study that found that more than a quarter of BNG units are at risk of leading to no tangible increases in biodiversity because there is no monitoring system in place. There are also concerns that there are too few ecologists to oversee habitats or score them correctly. Some may lack independence if they are employed by the developer. Tom Oliver, a professor of applied ecology at the University of Reading, said environmental regulations are typically let down by lax enforcement. \u201cBNG\u2019s success hinges on effective environmental regulation, monitoring and policing, and yet when you look at all our past case studies they clearly show a failure of environmental enforcement and policing,\u201d he said.

Zu Ermgassen was part of a study that found that more than a quarter of BNG units are at risk of leading to no tangible increases in biodiversity because there is no monitoring system in place. There are also concerns that there are too few ecologists to oversee habitats or score them correctly. Some may lack independence if they are employed by the developer.

{"text":"Grow your own The RHS gardening advice service and website continues to see growth in \u201cgrow your own\u201d. The most popular plants are tomatoes, followed by cucumbers, courgettes, chillies and runner beans. Purple power Purple vegetables have traditionally been difficult for the home gardener but now breeders have begun introducing purple varieties that are easier to grow than traditional ones and avoid previous drawbacks, such as non-fruiting and limited purple colour, especially after cooking. Gardeners and chefs can anticipate purple carrots, cauliflowers, broccoli, tomatoes, peas, radish, French beans and lettuces. Climate change fruits Recent hot dry summers are ideal for certain fruits, grape vines being an outstanding example \u2013 but others include figs, almonds, apricots, melons, peaches/nectarines and watermelons. Local seed provenances and survivalist gardens After the temporary hiccup to the vegetable supply chain last spring, some gardeners now favour growing with more independence, including where they source their seeds. Going wild Plants traditionally seen as unwanted weeds such as herb robert and plantain are becoming popular. Cow parsley is now a desirable border plant and dandelions are recognised as being key to providing food for bees early in springtime. Gardening with nature The move away from classical, formal layouts towards naturalistic landscapes will continue to grow, with gardens making people feel that they are in a wild place and providing benefits to wellbeing, wildlife and ease of maintenance. Planet-friendly gardening Gardeners will be increasingly in tune with nature: inquiries to the RHS about wildlife gardening increased by more than 28% in

The most popular plants are tomatoes, followed by cucumbers, courgettes, chillies and runner beans. Purple power Purple vegetables have traditionally been difficult for the home gardener but now breeders have begun introducing purple varieties that are easier to grow than traditional ones and avoid previous drawbacks, such as non-fruiting and limited purple colour, especially after cooking. Gardeners and chefs can anticipate purple carrots, cauliflowers, broccoli, tomatoes, peas, radish, French beans and lettuces. Climate change fruits Recent hot dry summers are ideal for certain fruits, grape vines being an outstanding example \u2013 but others include figs, almonds, apricots, melons, peaches/nectarines and watermelons. Local seed provenances and survivalist gardens After the temporary hiccup to the vegetable supply chain last spring, some gardeners now favour growing with more independence, including where they source their seeds. Going wild Plants traditionally seen as unwanted weeds such as herb robert and plantain are becoming popular. Cow parsley is now a desirable border plant and dandelions are recognised as being key to providing food for bees early in springtime. Gardening with nature The move away from classical, formal layouts towards naturalistic landscapes will continue to grow, with gardens making people feel that they are in a wild place and providing benefits to wellbeing, wildlife and ease of maintenance.

Animal guards \u2013 Frisbee-like plastic devices \u2013 are being attached where powerlines are the most affected, but the bats\u2019 flight paths are random, making it hard to be systematic. So crews put the guards on as they\u2019re working on other issues, or if they have spare time. \u201cWe will do everything we can to minimise the impact, but given the colonies are growing and we have hundreds of thousands of poles, we have a lot of work to do over the next decade installing animal guards and covering more of our powerlines to be able to significantly reduce what tend to be randomly located bat-related outages,\u201d Roberts says. Bats can carry lyssavirus, although human infection is rare. They can also carry Hendra virus, which can infect horses and from there be passed on to humans, but horse vaccinations have diminished that

This is simply the next step in Kingston Lacy\u2019s history and preservation.\u201d Griffith added: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found when we\u2019ve moved from fossil fuel conservation heating to heat pump conservation heating is that extending the heating time means that we have a longer duration of lower-grade heat coming into the building so it\u2019s a lot gentler.

Italian farmers also want the reinstatement of an income tax exemption scrapped in the government\u2019s 2024 budget. \u201cOur vehicles will converge around the capital,\u201d said Danilo Calvani, one of their leaders. \u201cNext week, there will be a big demonstration in Rome.\u201d In the financial hub of Milan, farmers paraded a cow during a demonstration outside the offices of the Lombardy regional government.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: move to a more sustainable model of production, explain grievances in a concrete, concise and unanimous way, revision of the European green deal, reinstatement of an income tax exemption\npolicy: European green deal\ntechnology: \nmethod: drastically reduce pesticides and fertilisers, attack on meat consumption"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772618,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"The book, out on 7 March and is aimed at older children (aged 9+) and adults, explains how and why Tree and her husband, Charlie Burrell, sold off their dairy cows and farm machinery in 2000. They stopped ploughing and spraying fertilisers and pesticides, pulled up their barbed wire fences, smashed their Victorian land drains, quit clearing their ditches \u2013 and \u201csimply let things go\u201d. \u201cWe wanted to work with nature for a change, rather than fighting against it all the time,\u201d writes Tree. Exquisite illustrations by the printmaker and fine artist Angela Harding reveal how, step-by-step, wilderness and wildlife then returned to Knepp. \u201cNature bounces back, if you let it, wherever it can.\u201d Some of the rarest creatures in Britain have now made Knepp their home, including kingfishers, hazel dormice, scarce chaser dragonflies and purple emperor butterflies. The river has returned to its natural course and the soil is now storing as much carbon per hectare as a 25-year-old plantation of trees does, according to recent tests. \u201cThat\u2019s really exciting, because rewilding has been seen as fantastic for wildlife and recovering biodiversity, but people say it doesn\u2019t answer the problem of climate change. We can say now, categorically, it does. That, actually, you can restore your soils by allowing an area to rewild \u2013 and just the soils alone will be the same as a carbon storage in a plantation.\u201d","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/25/rewilding-climate-change-biodiversity-isabella-tree-nature-planet-farming_1","publication_date":"2024-02-25T11:00:57Z"},"_input_hash":-829206429,"_task_hash":1789660022,"tokens":[{"text":"The","start":0,"end":3,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"book","start":4,"end":8,"id":1,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":8,"end":9,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"out","start":10,"end":13,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":14,"end":16,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"7","start":17,"end":18,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"March","start":19,"end":24,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":25,"end":28,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":29,"end":31,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"aimed","start":32,"end":37,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"at","start":38,"end":40,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"older","start":41,"end":46,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"children","start":47,"end":55,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":56,"end":57,"id":13,"ws":false},{"text":"aged","start":57,"end":61,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"9","start":62,"end":63,"id":15,"ws":false},{"text":"+","start":63,"end":64,"id":16,"ws":false},{"text":")","start":64,"end":65,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":66,"end":69,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"adults","start":70,"end":76,"id":19,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":76,"end":77,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"explains","start":78,"end":86,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"how","start":87,"end":90,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":91,"end":94,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"why","start":95,"end":98,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"Tree","start":99,"end":103,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":104,"end":107,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"her","start":108,"end":111,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"husband","start":112,"end":119,"id":28,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":119,"end":120,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"Charlie","start":121,"end":128,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"Burrell","start":129,"end":136,"id":31,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":136,"end":137,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"sold","start":138,"end":142,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"off","start":143,"end":146,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"their","start":147,"end":152,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"dairy","start":153,"end":158,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"cows","start":159,"end":163,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":164,"end":167,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"farm","start":168,"end":172,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"machinery","start":173,"end":182,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":183,"end":185,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"2000","start":186,"end":190,"id":42,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":190,"end":191,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"They","start":192,"end":196,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"stopped","start":197,"end":204,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"ploughing","start":205,"end":214,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":215,"end":218,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"spraying","start":219,"end":227,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"fertilisers","start":228,"end":239,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":240,"end":243,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"pesticides","start":244,"end":254,"id":51,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":254,"end":255,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"pulled","start":256,"end":262,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"up","start":263,"end":265,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"their","start":266,"end":271,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"barbed","start":272,"end":278,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"wire","start":279,"end":283,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"fences","start":284,"end":290,"id":58,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":290,"end":291,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"smashed","start":292,"end":299,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"their","start":300,"end":305,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"Victorian","start":306,"end":315,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"land","start":316,"end":320,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"drains","start":321,"end":327,"id":64,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":327,"end":328,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"quit","start":329,"end":333,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"clearing","start":334,"end":342,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"their","start":343,"end":348,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"ditches","start":349,"end":356,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"\u2013","start":357,"end":358,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":359,"end":362,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"\u201c","start":363,"end":364,"id":72,"ws":false},{"text":"simply","start":364,"end":370,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"let","start":371,"end":374,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"things","start":375,"end":381,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"go","start":382,"end":384,"id":76,"ws":false},{"text":"\u201d","start":384,"end":385,"id":77,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":385,"end":386,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"\u201c","start":387,"end":388,"id":79,"ws":false},{"text":"We","start":388,"end":390,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"wanted","start":391,"end":397,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":398,"end":400,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"work","start":401,"end":405,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":406,"end":410,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"nature","start":411,"end":

Over three decades, the 63-year-old \u201cTricky\u201d Nicholls has led thousands of divers and snorkelers on monthly clean-up dives while tracking trends in Sydney\u2019s marine plastics.

Maybe they tossed it over the Manly ferry, saying \u2018Yippee, I\u2019m free\u2019.\u201d While underwater, it\u2019s easy to spot an item at odds with nature\u2019s colour palette: a flash of neon pink tangled in blades of kelp isn\u2019t the scales of a fish \u2013 it\u2019s a raspberry vape. But some larger items, such as shopping trolleys, have been swallowed by the sea for so long they are camouflaged by moss and barnacles.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: monthly clean-up dives, tracking trends in Sydney\u2019s marine plastics\npolicy: \ntechnology: plastics, kelp, vape"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1710772628,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

{"text":"The higher temperatures increased from June, with September\u2019s heat so far above previous averages that one scientist called it \u201cgobsmackingly bananas\u201d. Carlo Buontempo, a CCCS director, said: \u201cThe extremes we have observed over the last few months provide a dramatic testimony of how far we now are from the climate in which our civilisation developed. \u201cThis has profound consequences for the Paris agreement and all human endeavours. If we want to successfully manage our climate risk, we need to urgently decarbonise our economy whilst using climate data and knowledge to prepare for the future.\u201d Scientists said recently that the Earth\u2019s life support systems have been so damaged that the planet was \u201cwell outside the safe operating space for humanity\u201d. Samantha Burgess, the CCCS deputy director, said: \u201c2023 was an exceptional year, with climate records tumbling like dominoes. Temperatures during 2023 likely exceed those of any period in at least the last 100,000 years.\u201d Prof Bill Collins, at the University of Reading, UK, said: \u201cIt is a shock that 2023 unarguably smashed the global temperature record. More global warming is expected to cause even wetter winters in the UK and yet more flooding.\u201d The CCCS highlighted a number of \u201cremarkable\u201d events in 2023, including huge blazes in Canada that helped drive up global carbon emissions from wildfires by 30%, and unprecedented ocean temperatures that caused marine heatwaves to strike many

Carlo Buontempo, a CCCS director, said: \u201cThe extremes we have observed over the last few months provide a dramatic testimony of how far we now are from the climate in which our civilisation developed. \u201cThis has profound consequences for the Paris agreement and all human endeavours. If we want to successfully manage our climate risk, we need to urgently decarbonise our economy whilst using climate data and knowledge to prepare for the future.\u201d Scientists said recently that the Earth\u2019s life support systems have been so damaged that the planet was \u201cwell outside the safe operating space for humanity\u201d. Samantha Burgess, the CCCS deputy director, said: \u201c2023 was an exceptional year, with climate records tumbling like dominoes. Temperatures during 2023 likely exceed those of any period in at least the last 100,000 years.\u201d Prof Bill Collins, at the University of Reading, UK, said: \u201cIt is a shock that 2023 unarguably smashed the global temperature record. More global warming is expected to cause even wetter winters in the UK and yet more flooding.\u201d The CCCS highlighted a number of \u201cremarkable\u201d events in 2023, including huge blazes in Canada that helped drive up global carbon emissions from wildfires by 30%, and unprecedented ocean temperatures that caused marine heatwaves to strike many regions.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: decarbonise our economy, prepare for the future\npolicy: Paris agreement\ntechnology: climate data\nmethod: urgently decarbonise our economy, using climate data and knowledge"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772638,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

{"text":"In an email to Environment Agency (EA) officials sent last February, the foundation said drainage water from the farms was \u201ca pollution risk and should not be directed to watercourses\u201d. It added that the issue was \u201cvery common and one that we have found very difficult to address\u201d. The charity was seeking guidance as to how the runoff should be treated. It is working with farmers to improve protection of the catchment area from effluent and agricultural drainage water. Simon Evans, chief executive of the foundation, said: \u2018Many of the challenges we are trying to resolve are the legacy of historic poor planning decisions, such as when the planners have insisted the units be located too close to watercourses. \u201cIn some cases, the solutions are not obvious and require careful consideration along with guidance from regulators. Noble has been actively engaged in helping to find and fund solutions on the farms that supply them, and their support is driving the progress that is being made to resolve the issues.\u201d River Action is seeking a judicial review of the EA over allegations it had failed to protect the Wye from agricultural pollution. It is claimed the agency has failed to prevent the spreading of excess organic manure or properly apply the rules. Ricardo Gama, a solicitor at Leigh Day, which is representing River Action in the judicial review, due to be heard next month at the high court in Cardiff, said: \u201cRiver Action\u2019s ultimate

It is working with farmers to improve protection of the catchment area from effluent and agricultural drainage water. Simon Evans, chief executive of the foundation, said: \u2018Many of the challenges we are trying to resolve are the legacy of historic poor planning decisions, such as when the planners have insisted the units be located too close to watercourses. \u201cIn some cases, the solutions are not obvious and require careful consideration along with guidance from regulators. Noble has been actively engaged in helping to find and fund solutions on the farms that supply them, and their support is driving the progress that is being made to resolve the issues.\u201d River Action is seeking a judicial review of the EA over allegations it had failed to protect the Wye from agricultural pollution. It is claimed the agency has failed to prevent the spreading of excess organic manure or properly apply the rules. Ricardo Gama, a solicitor at Leigh Day, which is representing River Action in the judicial review, due to be heard next month at the high court in Cardiff, said: \u201cRiver Action\u2019s ultimate goal is that the agency takes a strong hand and actually starts enforcing these rules.\u201d\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: improve protection of the catchment area from effluent and agricultural drainage water, find and fund solutions on the farms\npolicy: \ntechnology: drainage water, runoff, agricultural pollution, excess organic manure"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772657,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"The winter arrival of migrant redwings and fieldfares didn\u2019t seem to make much impact until the first snow fell, then the fruits disappeared quickly. The easy pickings are long gone. Spring still seems distant up here. Halfway down the hill, the redwings \u2013 formerly flighty, chattering flocks that peered down on passersby from the treetops \u2013 are grounded in roadside pastures. In another month ivy berries will be ripe and ready, but for now these foragers have been brought down to earth by the need for a change in diet. Their beaks, probing in waterlogged ground for worms and leatherjackets, are stained with mud. One of the pleasures of living in the Pennines is that seasons can be transcended just by walking uphill or downhill: the illusion of cheating time with a small shift in altitude. At the bottom of the bank, sheltered from cold winds, a few hawthorn leaf buds are already breaking.

{"text":"The team is investigating the consequences for the marine ecosystem: from nutrient cycling to ice algae and plankton productivity to seafloor animal communities that live on organic material raining down from the surface ocean. An ice core drilled from sea ice in the central Arctic Ocean The central Arctic is heating up much faster than most of the world. The area covered by sea ice in the Arctic Ocean at the end of summer has shrunk by about 40%, or 2.5m square kilometres \u2013 roughly the size of the Mediterranean Sea \u2013 since satellite observations began in the late 1970s. The remaining ice is getting thinner and multi-year floes \u2013 ice that has survived at least one summer \u2013 are becoming rarer. The waters around the north pole could be virtually free of ice at the end of the summer as early as the 2030s, according to a recent study. Shrinking ice cover means not only the loss of hunting grounds of polar bears or resting places and nurseries for seals, but also of an entire under-ice ecosystem: meadows of filamentous ice algae, algae-grazing zooplankton, and juvenile polar cod, which find food and shelter in the cracks and crevices beneath the floes and, when grown up, feed larger predators such as ringed seals or beluga whales. In the short term, sea ice productivity could increase as more sunlight passes through thinner floes, boosting ice algae growth, but only as long as there is a sufficient supply of nutrients in the overall nutrient-poor central Arctic Ocean. The same goes for planktonic algae, or phytoplankton, which profit from higher light availability and a longer growth season in the expanding open-water areas, as satellite data shows. Changes in productivity and a shift from ice algae to phytoplankton at the base of the food web will probably have major effects on the marine ecosystem as whole. Also, the native flora and fauna are facing new competition from invasive species, from plankton to fish, that are moving in from the Atlantic and Pacific as the oceans

An ice core drilled from sea ice in the central Arctic Ocean The central Arctic is heating up much faster than most of the world. The area covered by sea ice in the Arctic Ocean at the end of summer has shrunk by about 40%, or 2.5m square kilometres \u2013 roughly the size of the Mediterranean Sea \u2013 since satellite observations began in the late 1970s. The remaining ice is getting thinner and multi-year floes \u2013 ice that has survived at least one summer \u2013 are becoming rarer. The waters around the north pole could be virtually free of ice at the end of the summer as early as the 2030s, according to a recent study. Shrinking ice cover means not only the loss of hunting grounds of polar bears or resting places and nurseries for seals, but also of an entire under-ice ecosystem: meadows of filamentous ice algae, algae-grazing zooplankton, and juvenile polar cod, which find food and shelter in the cracks and crevices beneath the floes and, when grown up, feed larger predators such as ringed seals or beluga whales. In the short term, sea ice productivity could increase as more sunlight passes through thinner floes, boosting ice algae growth, but only as long as there is a sufficient supply of nutrients in the overall nutrient-poor central Arctic Ocean. The same goes for planktonic algae, or phytoplankton, which profit from higher light availability and a longer growth season in the expanding open-water areas, as satellite data shows. Changes in productivity and a shift from ice algae to phytoplankton at the base of the food web will probably have major effects on the marine ecosystem as whole. Also, the native flora and fauna are facing new competition from invasive species, from plankton to fish, that are moving in from the Atlantic and Pacific as the oceans warm.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: investigating the consequences for the marine ecosystem, nutrient cycling, ice algae and plankton productivity, seafloor animal communities\npolicy: \ntechnology: satellite observations, ice core drilling, multi-year floes, ice algae, phytoplankton, invasive species"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1710772702,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"Of the remaining areas, 47 were rated as having notably high levels, and 76 \u2013 more than half \u2013 were deemed exceptionally high. The Kent area, known as \u201cthe garden of England\u201d and home to many arable farmers, experienced its wettest 12-month period since records began. Regions near major rivers such as the Wear, Don, Calder, Derwent, Mersey and Irwell reported the wettest six-month period since records began. While January provided some respite, the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH) said the saturation from the previous months of heavy rain meant soil had not had a chance to dry out, and the high February rain meant problems persisted. For the 1,500 delegates at the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) conference this week, flooding was top of the agenda in the conference halls and coffee breaks. In her welcome speech, Minette Batters, the outgoing NFU president, singled out the extreme weather, saying some winter crops did not get planted, while others had been washed away. That was the experience of Henry Moreton, a cereals farmer and Lincolnshire county vice-chair for the NFU. About 150 acres of his land has been flooded since early autumn, with some areas under as much as five metres (15ft) of water. \u201cThis is the worst year we have ever had for flooding,\u201d he says. His oilseed rape, winter wheat and barley crops have been decimated, with losses estimated in the six

Regions near major rivers such as the Wear, Don, Calder, Derwent, Mersey and Irwell reported the wettest six-month period since records began. While January provided some respite, the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH) said the saturation from the previous months of heavy rain meant soil had not had a chance to dry out, and the high February rain meant problems persisted. For the 1,500 delegates at the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) conference this week, flooding was top of the agenda in the conference halls and coffee breaks. In her welcome speech, Minette Batters, the outgoing NFU president, singled out the extreme weather, saying some winter crops did not get planted, while others had been washed away. That was the experience of Henry Moreton, a cereals farmer and Lincolnshire county vice-chair for the NFU. About 150 acres of his land has been flooded since early autumn, with some areas under as much as five metres (15ft) of water. \u201cThis is the worst year we have ever had for flooding,\u201d he says.

For example, 'solar panels' or 'electric vehicles'.\n\n\nBelow are some examples (only use these as a guide):\n\nText:\n'''\nSunrise, the new solar panel project, is expected to be completed by 2022.\n'''\n\nproject: Sunrise\ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: solar panel\n\nText:\n'''\nadvances in soil science, like leveraging microorganisms for rejuvenation, are being used to improve crop yields.\n'''\n\nproject: \ninitiative: improve crop yields, leveraging microorganisms for rejuvenation\npolicy: \ntechnology: \n\nText:\n'''\nThe commission discussed Kigali Amendment on HFCs, a controversial climate policy which was met with mixed reviews.\n'''\n\nproject: \ninitiative: \npolicy: Kigali Amendment on HFCs\ntechnology: \n\n\nHere is the text that needs labeling:\n\nText:\n'''\nIf Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour wins the next UK general election, Chaudhary has \u201cvery little hope\u201d this will mean \u201cany appreciable change for climate issues\u201d, he says. Leftwing climate realists must think outside of the box, \u201cnot only to influence major parties\u201d but to build networks of people and groups beyond these traditional political spaces. Emotions can help with this because they are how people \u201crelate to the world\u201d, he says. But aside from ecoanxiety (an overwhelming disquiet about environmental crisis) and solastalgia (the distress caused by the environmental changes where you live, causing a kind of homesickness), how we feel, a more \u201cinchoate\u201d sense of exhaustion, is missing from a lot of climate texts, he says. \u201cI might feel exhaustion in a particular way \u2013 like burnout, that\u2019s very common for someone in my social position in a place like the United States,\u201d Chaudhary explains, \u201cbut someone else might be feeling it as pure bodily fatigue [and] someone else might be feeling it as \u2018my people have never had a chance to express ourselves\u2019.\u201d Tapping into this can unite people, he says. This makes a lot of sense. But halfway through reading Exhausted of the Earth, I wonder whether it could also be demobilising? If we\u2019re uniting over how exhausted we are, might we end up deciding we\u2019re too exhausted to do anything about it?\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: think outside of the box, build networks of people and groups\npolicy: \ntechnology: ecoanxiety, solastalgia"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772714,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
