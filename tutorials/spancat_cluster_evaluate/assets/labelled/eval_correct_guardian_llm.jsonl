{"text":"A climate protest group backed by a cadre of Hollywood film-makers is preparing to take action against \u201ccowards\u201d and \u201ccriminals\u201d of all political stripes as the 2024 election approaches. Climate Defiance, which disrupted events featuring a string of Biden administration officials this year, and targeted Darren Woods, CEO of ExxonMobil, in December, will consider protesting at events staged by both Democrats and Republicans on the campaign trail after concluding that its \u201cvery disruptive\u201d action was bearing fruit. In an interview, Michael Greenberg, the group\u2019s co-founder, told the Guardian it will also focus \u201cmore and more\u201d on state-level demonstrations designed to deter policymakers from approving fossil fuel projects. Since demonstrating outside the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner in the spring, its activists have staged protests at events featuring a string of senior federal officials, including the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, and the energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm. Climate Defiance has also interrupted two separate public appearances by the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. It is now recruiting for an organizing director to help coordinate \u201cdisruptive, nonviolent direct action to resist fossil fuel extraction\u201d, according to a job advertisement. \u201cIf we were a new group asking nicely, we\u2019d be a random no-name group and the White House could just have conversations with groups a hundred times our size who did the same thing,\u201d said Greenberg, 30. \u201cWhy would they talk to us?\u201d Instead, the group claims its demonstrations at high-profile events have got it a seat at the table. Ali Zaidi, the national climate adviser, has been on the phone.","meta":{"id":"environment/2023/dec/26/climate-defiance-change-protesters-confrontation_0","publication_date":"2023-12-26T13:00:36Z"},"_input_hash":1057026128,"_task_hash":570323915,"tokens":[{"text":"A","start":0,"end":1,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"climate","start":2,"end":9,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"protest","start":10,"end":17,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"group","start":18,"end":23,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"backed","start":24,"end":30,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":31,"end":33,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":34,"end":35,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"cadre","start":36,"end":41,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":42,"end":44,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"Hollywood","start":45,"end":54,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"film","start":55,"end":59,"id":10,"ws":false},{"text":"-","start":59,"end":60,"id":11,"ws":false},{"text":"makers","start":60,"end":66,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":67,"end":69,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"preparing","start":70,"end":79,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":80,"end":82,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"take","start":83,"end":87,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"action","start":88,"end":94,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"against","start":95,"end":102,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"\u201c","start":103,"end":104,"id":19,"ws":false},{"text":"cowards","start":104,"end":111,"id":20,"ws":false},{"text":"\u201d","start":111,"end":112,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":113,"end":116,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"\u201c","start":117,"end":118,"id":23,"ws":false},{"text":"criminals","start":118,"end":127,"id":24,"ws":false},{"text":"\u201d","start":127,"end":128,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":129,"end":131,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"all","start":132,"end":135,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"political","start":136,"end":145,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"stripes","start":146,"end":153,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":154,"end":156,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":157,"end":160,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"2024","start":161,"end":165,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"election","start":166,"end":174,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"approaches","start":175,"end":185,"id":34,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":185,"end":186,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"Climate","start":187,"end":194,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"Defiance","start":195,"end":203,"id":37,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":203,"end":204,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"which","start":205,"end":210,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"disrupted","start":211,"end":220,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"events","start":221,"end":227,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"featuring","start":228,"end":237,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":238,"end":239,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"string","start":240,"end":246,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":247,"end":249,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"Biden","start":250,"end":255,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"administration","start":256,"end":270,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"officials","start":271,"end":280,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"this","start":281,"end":285,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"year","start":286,"end":290,"id":50,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":290,"end":291,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":292,"end":295,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"targeted","start":296,"end":304,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"Darren","start":305,"end":311,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"Woods","start":312,"end":317,"id":55,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":317,"end":318,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"CEO","start":319,"end":322,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":323,"end":325,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"ExxonMobil","start":326,"end":336,"id":59,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":336,"end":337,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":338,"end":340,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"December","start":341,"end":349,"id":62,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":349,"end":350,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"will","start":351,"end":355,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"consider","start":356,"end":364,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"protesting","start":365,"end":375,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"at","start":376,"end":378,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"events","start":379,"end":385,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"staged","start":386,"end":392,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":393,"end":395,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"both","start":396,"end":400,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"Democrats","start":401,"end":410,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":411,"end":414,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"Republicans","start":415,"end":426,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":427,"end":429,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":430,"end":433,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"campaign","start":434,"end":442,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"trail","start":443,"end":448,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"after","start":449,"end":454,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"concluding","start":455,"end":465,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":466,"end":470,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"its","start":471,"end":474,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"\u201c","start":475,"end":476,"id":83,"ws":false},{"text":"very","start":476,"end":480,"id"

The requirement becomes law under the Town and Country Planning Act on 12 February for larger sites, and on 2 April 2024 for smaller sites. The scheme will make people think about how to minimise and mitigate the ecosystem impact of new developments, said Natalie Duffus, a biology and geographer researcher from the University of Oxford, who analysed the impact of BNG trials on conservation. \u201cIn theory, it could restore lots of habitats,\u201d she added. The government has a target of building 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s. Land affected by those developments must be compensated for under the new rules. Internationally, \u201cit\u2019s one of the most ambitious schemes we\u2019ve seen\u201d, said Duffus.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/12/england-brings-in-biodiversity-net-gain-rules-to-force-builders-to-compensate-for-loss-of-nature_0","publication_date":"2024-02-12T00:01:25Z"},"_input_hash":1772681235,"_task_hash":2020280019,"tokens":[{"text":"England","start":0,"end":7,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":8,"end":10,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"launching","start":11,"end":20,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":21,"end":22,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"biodiversity","start":23,"end":35,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"credit","start":36,"end":42,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"scheme","start":43,"end":49,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"this","start":50,"end":54,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"week","start":55,"end":59,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":60,"end":64,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"attempts","start":65,"end":73,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":74,"end":76,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"force","start":77,"end":82,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"all","start":83,"end":86,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"new","start":87,"end":90,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"road","start":91,"end":95,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":96,"end":99,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"housebuilding","start":100,"end":113,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"projects","start":114,"end":122,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":123,"end":125,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"benefit","start":126,"end":133,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"nature","start":134,"end":140,"id":21,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":140,"end":141,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"rather","start":142,"end":148,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"than","start":149,"end":153,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"damage","start":154,"end":160,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":161,"end":163,"id":26,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":163,"end":164,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"The","start":165,"end":168,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"\u201c","start":169,"end":170,"id":29,"ws":false},{"text":"nature","start":170,"end":176,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"market","start":177,"end":183,"id":31,"ws":false},{"text":"\u201d","start":183,"end":184,"id":32,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":184,"end":185,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"called","start":186,"end":192,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"biodiversity","start":193,"end":205,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"net","start":206,"end":209,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"gain","start":210,"end":214,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":215,"end":216,"id":38,"ws":false},{"text":"BNG","start":216,"end":219,"id":39,"ws":false},{"text":")","start":219,"end":220,"id":40,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":220,"end":221,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"means","start":222,"end":227,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"all","start":228,"end":231,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"new","start":232,"end":235,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"building","start":236,"end":244,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"projects","start":245,"end":253,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"must","start":254,"end":258,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"achieve","start":259,"end":266,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":267,"end":268,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"10","start":269,"end":271,"id":50,"ws":false},{"text":"%","start":271,"end":272,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"net","start":273,"end":276,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"gain","start":277,"end":281,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":282,"end":284,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"biodiversity","start":285,"end":297,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"or","start":298,"end":300,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"habitat","start":301,"end":308,"id":57,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":308,"end":309,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"If","start":310,"end":312,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":313,"end":314,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"woodland","start":315,"end":323,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":324,"end":326,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"destroyed","start":327,"end":336,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":337,"end":339,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":340,"end":341,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"road","start":342,"end":346,"id":66,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":346,"end":347,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":348,"end":351,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"example","start":352,"end":359,"id":69,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":359,"end":360,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"another","start":361,"end":368,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"needs","start":369,"end":374,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":375,"end":377,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":378,"end":380,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"recreated","start":381,"end":390,"id":75,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":390,"end":391,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"This","start":392,"end":396,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"can","start":397,"end":400,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"happen","start":401,"end":407,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"either","start":408,"end":414,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":415,"end":417,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"site","start":418,"end":422,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"or","start":423,"end":425,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"elsewhere","start":426,"end":435,"id":84,"w

{"text":"A commitment to restoration is essential, according to Inger Andersen, executive director of UNEP, who noted it was no longer enough to merely protect what was left of Africa\u2019s fertile land. This continent will be home to a quarter of the world\u2019s population in little more than a generation and many areas have already degraded into semi-barren drylands. \u201cInitiatives like TREES are playing an important role in reversing decades of ecosystem degradation, especially across the Sahel, pushing back desertification, increasing climate resilience and improving the wellbeing of farmers and their communities,\u201d Andersen said in announcing the World Restoration Flagship. While there is no doubt about the need for reforestation, there are historical reasons to be sceptical about the effectiveness of such programmes. Expectations are often too high. A 2019 study suggesting the climate crisis could be significantly eased by planting a trillion trees across the world was later debunked as unrealistic because there was not enough suitable land. Many governments have launched mass tree-planting campaigns, but after the initial day or two of publicity, there is rarely sufficient irrigation, protection and other follow-up to ensure seeds and saplings grow into trunks and branches. Often such national initiatives are little more than greenwashing distractions from far greater forest destruction elsewhere. Kenya, for example, has launched numerous tree-planting initiatives in recent decades, including the Million Operation Gavisha in 1977, the Trees Campaign in 2006, the Greening Kenya Initiative in 2010 and the Accelerated National Tree Growing Campaign 2022, yet overall, it has lost 11% of its tree cover since 2000. The situation has stabilised somewhat in the past two years under the current president, William Ruto, who has declared an annual tree-planting holiday and set a national target to plant 15bn trees and raise tree cover to 30% by

This continent will be home to a quarter of the world\u2019s population in little more than a generation and many areas have already degraded into semi-barren drylands. \u201cInitiatives like TREES are playing an important role in reversing decades of ecosystem degradation, especially across the Sahel, pushing back desertification, increasing climate resilience and improving the wellbeing of farmers and their communities,\u201d Andersen said in announcing the World Restoration Flagship. While there is no doubt about the need for reforestation, there are historical reasons to be sceptical about the effectiveness of such programmes. Expectations are often too high. A 2019 study suggesting the climate crisis could be significantly eased by planting a trillion trees across the world was later debunked as unrealistic because there was not enough suitable land. Many governments have launched mass tree-planting campaigns, but after the initial day or two of publicity, there is rarely sufficient irrigation, protection and other follow-up to ensure seeds and saplings grow into trunks and branches. Often such national initiatives are little more than greenwashing distractions from far greater forest destruction elsewhere. Kenya, for example, has launched numerous tree-planting initiatives in recent decades, including the Million Operation Gavisha in 1977, the Trees Campaign in 2006, the Greening Kenya Initiative in 2010 and the Accelerated National Tree Growing Campaign 2022, yet overall, it has lost 11% of its tree cover since 2000. The situation has stabilised somewhat in the past two years under the current president, William Ruto, who has declared an annual tree-planting holiday and set a national target to plant 15bn trees and raise tree cover to 30% by 2032.\n'''"],"response":["project: TREES, World Restoration Flagship, Million Operation Gavisha, Trees Campaign, Greening Kenya Initiative, Accelerated National Tree Growing Campaign\ninitiative: restoration, reversing decades of ecosystem degradation, pushing back desertification, increasing climate resilience, improving the wellbeing of farmers and their communities, mass tree-planting campaigns\npolicy: \ntechnology: reforestation, irrigation, protection, tree-planting initiatives"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772296,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"Children with more green space near their homes have significantly stronger bones, a study has found, potentially leading to lifelong health benefits. Scientists found that the children living in places with 20-25% more natural areas had increased bone strength that was equivalent to half a year\u2019s natural growth. The study, the first of its kind, also found that the risk of having very low bone density was about 65% lower for these children. Bone strength grows in childhood and adolescence, before plateauing until about the age of 50 and then declining. Increasing the size and accessibility of green spaces for children could therefore prevent fractures and osteoporosis in older people, the researchers said. The link between green spaces and stronger bones is likely to result from higher levels of physical activity in children who live near parks, as this spurs bone growth. The connection was strongest for green spaces with trees, which the scientists said may be because these were more attractive places to visit. \u201cThe stronger the bone mass is during childhood, the more capacity you have for later in life,\u201d said Prof Tim Nawrot, at Hasselt University in Belgium, who was part of the study team with Dr Hanne Sleurs and others. \u201cSo the real public health message from this study is that urban planners can make stronger bones of children, and that has long-lasting consequences.\u201d Previous research has found greater access to green spaces increases physical activity in

Scientists found that the children living in places with 20-25% more natural areas had increased bone strength that was equivalent to half a year\u2019s natural growth. The study, the first of its kind, also found that the risk of having very low bone density was about 65% lower for these children. Bone strength grows in childhood and adolescence, before plateauing until about the age of 50 and then declining. Increasing the size and accessibility of green spaces for children could therefore prevent fractures and osteoporosis in older people, the researchers said. The link between green spaces and stronger bones is likely to result from higher levels of physical activity in children who live near parks, as this spurs bone growth. The connection was strongest for green spaces with trees, which the scientists said may be because these were more attractive places to visit. \u201cThe stronger the bone mass is during childhood, the more capacity you have for later in life,\u201d said Prof Tim Nawrot, at Hasselt University in Belgium, who was part of the study team with Dr Hanne Sleurs and others. \u201cSo the real public health message from this study is that urban planners can make stronger bones of children, and that has long-lasting consequences.\u201d Previous research has found greater access to green spaces increases physical activity in children.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: increasing the size and accessibility of green spaces for children, prevent fractures and osteoporosis in older people\npolicy: \ntechnology: green spaces, trees"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772306,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"Scientists are starting to count the health cost of heating our homes with wood. One study, in Canberra in Australia, has found that deaths from everyday exposure to smoke from wood burners is comparable with those during the unprecedented \u201cblack summer\u201d bushfires of 2019/2020. Prof Sotiris Vardoulakis, part of the research team and director of the Healthy Environments and Lives (Heal) National Research Network, described winter in the city: \u201cWhen I take my two boys to play basketball outdoors in winter, or when we walk the dog before dinner, there is always a smell of wood smoke in the air.\u201d Vardoulakis and his team found that wood-heating was causing up to a quarter of the particle pollution in Canberra. Combining this information on the health harm from air pollution, they estimated that between 17 and 63 deaths were attributable annually to wood smoke in the Australian Capital Territory, which has a population of about 450,000. This shortening of life means an annual loss of A$92m to A$333m (\u00a348m to \u00a3173m) to Australian society. The health impact of this regular winter burning was comparable to the deaths during the 2019-2020 \u201cblack summer\u201d bushfires from smoke. Vardoulakis said: \u201cCanberra suffers from winter pollution, largely due to wood-heaters. There are many complaints from families with asthma, but also from people without chronic health conditions. They feel

Prof Sotiris Vardoulakis, part of the research team and director of the Healthy Environments and Lives (Heal) National Research Network, described winter in the city: \u201cWhen I take my two boys to play basketball outdoors in winter, or when we walk the dog before dinner, there is always a smell of wood smoke in the air.\u201d Vardoulakis and his team found that wood-heating was causing up to a quarter of the particle pollution in Canberra. Combining this information on the health harm from air pollution, they estimated that between 17 and 63 deaths were attributable annually to wood smoke in the Australian Capital Territory, which has a population of about 450,000. This shortening of life means an annual loss of A$92m to A$333m (\u00a348m to \u00a3173m) to Australian society. The health impact of this regular winter burning was comparable to the deaths during the 2019-2020 \u201cblack summer\u201d bushfires from smoke. Vardoulakis said: \u201cCanberra suffers from winter pollution, largely due to wood-heaters. There are many complaints from families with asthma, but also from people without chronic health conditions. They feel hopeless.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: wood burners, particle pollution, air pollution, wood smoke, wood-heating"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772317,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"A South Fulham east neighbourhood project was made permanent in December 2021. The council published a report on Friday proposing a similar trial scheme introduced in February 2023, known as the South Fulham west project, be made permanent. Average traffic flows lower on residential roads and some main arterial roads between March 2022, before the trial, and March 2023 during it. The market research agency Opinium polled residents in the trial area: 59% supported reducing out-of-borough traffic using neighbourhood streets as cut-throughs. The polling firm also conducted an online consultation of residents and businesses in the borough: 52% of respondents supported the principle of reducing out-of-borough traffic using neighbourhood streets as cut-throughs, and 59% of businesses were opposed. Hands, a trade minister and minister for London, said his own survey published last year found 70% of residents do not support the schemes. He said he had been contacted by many businesses and residents about the impact on the area. \u201cBusinesses say no one want to come to them any more because they spend too long in traffic.\u201d Hands said he did not own a car and used public transport in the borough, but considered the scheme was ill-thought out and the council should \u201cgo back to the drawing board\u201d. He said he doubted whether people would vote at the general election on their views on traffic schemes.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/25/support-for-clean-air-traffic-scheme-in-chelsea-plunges-tory-mp-into-row_1","publication_date":"2024-02-25T08:00:52Z"},"_input_hash":1247497121,"_task_hash":934587717,"tokens":[{"text":"A","start":0,"end":1,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"South","start":2,"end":7,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"Fulham","start":8,"end":14,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"east","start":15,"end":19,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"neighbourhood","start":20,"end":33,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"project","start":34,"end":41,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"was","start":42,"end":45,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"made","start":46,"end":50,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"permanent","start":51,"end":60,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":61,"end":63,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"December","start":64,"end":72,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"2021","start":73,"end":77,"id":11,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":77,"end":78,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"The","start":79,"end":82,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"council","start":83,"end":90,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"published","start":91,"end":100,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":101,"end":102,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"report","start":103,"end":109,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":110,"end":112,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"Friday","start":113,"end":119,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"proposing","start":120,"end":129,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":130,"end":131,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"similar","start":132,"end":139,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"trial","start":140,"end":145,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"scheme","start":146,"end":152,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"introduced","start":153,"end":163,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":164,"end":166,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"February","start":167,"end":175,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"2023","start":176,"end":180,"id":28,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":180,"end":181,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"known","start":182,"end":187,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":188,"end":190,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":191,"end":194,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"South","start":195,"end":200,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"Fulham","start":201,"end":207,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"west","start":208,"end":212,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"project","start":213,"end":220,"id":36,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":220,"end":221,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":222,"end":224,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"made","start":225,"end":229,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"permanent","start":230,"end":239,"id":40,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":239,"end":240,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"Average","start":241,"end":248,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"traffic","start":249,"end":256,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"flows","start":257,"end":262,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"lower","start":263,"end":268,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":269,"end":271,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"residential","start":272,"end":283,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"roads","start":284,"end":289,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":290,"end":293,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"some","start":294,"end":298,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"main","start":299,"end":303,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"arterial","start":304,"end":312,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"roads","start":313,"end":318,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"between","start":319,"end":326,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"March","start":327,"end":332,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"2022","start":333,"end":337,"id":56,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":337,"end":338,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"before","start":339,"end":345,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":346,"end":349,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"trial","start":350,"end":355,"id":60,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":355,"end":356,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":357,"end":360,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"March","start":361,"end":366,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"2023","start":367,"end":371,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"during","start":372,"end":378,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":379,"end":381,"id":66,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":381,"end":382,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"The","start":383,"end":386,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"market","start":387,"end":393,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"research","start":394,"end":402,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"agency","start":403,"end":409,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"Opinium","start":410,"end":417,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"polled","start":418,"end":424,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"residents","start":425,"end":434,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":435,"end":437,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":438,"end":441,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"trial","start":442,"end":447,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"area","start":448,"end":452,"id":78,"ws":false},{"text":":","start":452,"end":453,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"59","start":454,"end":456,"id":80,"ws":false},{"text":"%","start":456,"end":457,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"supported","start":458,"end":467,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"reducing","start":468,"end":476,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"out","start":477,"end":480,"id":8

Average traffic flows lower on residential roads and some main arterial roads between March 2022, before the trial, and March 2023 during it. The market research agency Opinium polled residents in the trial area: 59% supported reducing out-of-borough traffic using neighbourhood streets as cut-throughs. The polling firm also conducted an online consultation of residents and businesses in the borough: 52% of respondents supported the principle of reducing out-of-borough traffic using neighbourhood streets as cut-throughs, and 59% of businesses were opposed. Hands, a trade minister and minister for London, said his own survey published last year found 70% of residents do not support the schemes. He said he had been contacted by many businesses and residents about the impact on the area. \u201cBusinesses say no one want to come to them any more because they spend too long in traffic.\u201d Hands said he did not own a car and used public transport in the borough, but considered the scheme was ill-thought out and the council should \u201cgo back to the drawing board\u201d.

This year is the worst I can remember. Golf courses are classic breeding grounds \u2013 toads love it.\u201d For the third year running, Australians living across the cane toad\u2019s territory are being asked to be a part of the Great Cane Toad Bust run by the not-for-profit community environment group Watergum. Gloves, bucket and a torch are the basic kit. At last year\u2019s Great Cane Toad Bust, Middap and his mates took out the unofficial top ranking, grabbing more than 2,700 toads from the estate\u2019s golf course and back yards. This year\u2019s event \u2013 to be held from 13 to 21 January \u2013 follows months of weather that has been great for cane toads. Dr Jodi Rowley, a frog biologist at the Australian Museum and the University of New South Wales, says the warm and wet conditions as well as flooding in recent months are perfect conditions for all amphibians \u2013 including cane toads.

{"text":"A frog species that is in a \u201cperilous state\u201d due to an infectious disease has been successfully bred at a wildlife park in Oxfordshire. Keepers at the Cotswold wildlife park in Burford have again bred the near-threatened cinnamon frog, four years after it became only the second zoological collection in Europe to breed the species. Reptile keepers have paid homage to the name and called the froglets after different coloured spices including paprika, cayenne, saffron, chipotle and chilli, and they are being looked after in a specialist amphibian breeding room. Jamie Craig, general manager of Cotswold wildlife park, said the species is in a \u201cperilous state\u201d due to the chytrid fungus, an infectious disease in frogs. He said: \u201cOur dedicated reptile team have been working hard to perfect breeding techniques in our Amphibian Room. \u201cMany frog species have incredibly specific requirements, and it is a testament to their hard work that they have now managed to replicate our previous success with the cinnamon frogs. \u201cWith the perilous state of many amphibian species in the world due to the Chytrid fungus, any expertise garnered from the captive populations may well be important tools for the future of these fascinating creatures.\u201d Only five other zoos in Europe keep the species with one other successfully breeding the frogs in the last 12 months, according to the wildlife park. The amphibians, known for their distinctive reddish-brown colour, similar to cinnamon, and black-and-white spots across their bodies, are native to parts of south-east Asia including Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Sumatra.

Keepers at the Cotswold wildlife park in Burford have again bred the near-threatened cinnamon frog, four years after it became only the second zoological collection in Europe to breed the species. Reptile keepers have paid homage to the name and called the froglets after different coloured spices including paprika, cayenne, saffron, chipotle and chilli, and they are being looked after in a specialist amphibian breeding room. Jamie Craig, general manager of Cotswold wildlife park, said the species is in a \u201cperilous state\u201d due to the chytrid fungus, an infectious disease in frogs.

Samples of plants close to sites where birds have been found are also being checked. Researchers have ruled out any infectious disease and there is no evidence so far that chemicals such as pesticides are to blame. Phalen says the working hypothesis is that the birds are being affected by a toxin such as a bacteria or fungi, which could be growing on the plants they feed on. Rainbow lorikeets feed on nectar, pollen and native fruits. But narrowing down what they are eating will be difficult.

country.","meta":{"id":"environment/2023/dec/21/prosanta-chakrabarty-i-discovered-cavefish-big-sickness-aoe_1","publication_date":"2023-12-21T10:00:22Z"},"_input_hash":-1910555604,"_task_hash":84056204,"tokens":[{"text":"They","start":0,"end":4,"id":0,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019re","start":4,"end":7,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"often","start":8,"end":13,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"only","start":14,"end":18,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"three","start":19,"end":24,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"inches","start":25,"end":31,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"long","start":32,"end":36,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"so","start":37,"end":39,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":40,"end":42,"id":8,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":42,"end":44,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"not","start":45,"end":48,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":49,"end":53,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"scary","start":54,"end":59,"id":12,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":59,"end":60,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"But","start":61,"end":64,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":65,"end":67,"id":15,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":67,"end":69,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":70,"end":71,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"privilege","start":72,"end":81,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"seeing","start":82,"end":88,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"wildlife","start":89,"end":97,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"coming","start":98,"end":104,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"towards","start":105,"end":112,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"you","start":113,"end":116,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"\u2013","start":117,"end":118,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":119,"end":123,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"rarely","start":124,"end":130,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"happens","start":131,"end":138,"id":27,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":138,"end":139,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"I","start":140,"end":141,"id":29,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019m","start":141,"end":143,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":144,"end":145,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"systematist","start":146,"end":157,"id":32,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":157,"end":158,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"which","start":159,"end":164,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":165,"end":167,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"someone","start":168,"end":175,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"who","start":176,"end":179,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"studies","start":180,"end":187,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":188,"end":191,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"tree","start":192,"end":196,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":197,"end":199,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"life","start":200,"end":204,"id":42,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":204,"end":205,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"figuring","start":206,"end":214,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"out","start":215,"end":218,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"who","start":219,"end":222,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":223,"end":225,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"related","start":226,"end":233,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":234,"end":236,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"who","start":237,"end":240,"id":50,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":240,"end":241,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"often","start":242,"end":247,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":248,"end":252,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"DNA","start":253,"end":256,"id":54,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":256,"end":257,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"Sometimes","start":258,"end":267,"id":56,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":267,"end":268,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"we","start":269,"end":271,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"add","start":272,"end":275,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"new","start":276,"end":279,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"branches","start":280,"end":288,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":289,"end":291,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":292,"end":295,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"tree","start":296,"end":300,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":301,"end":303,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"discovering","start":304,"end":315,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"species","start":316,"end":323,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"new","start":324,"end":327,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":328,"end":330,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"science","start":331,"end":338,"id":70,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":338,"end":339,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"I","start":340,"end":341,"id":72,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019ve","start":341,"end":344,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"described","start":345,"end":354,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"15","start":355,"end":357,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"species","start":358,"end":365,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":366,"end":368,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"fish","start":369,"end":373,"id":78,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":373,"end":374,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"several","start":375,"end":382,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":383,"end":385,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"them","start":386,"end":390,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"cavefish","start":391,"end":399,"id":83,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":399,"end":400,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"My","start":401,"end":403,"id":85,"ws":tr

{"text":"The granman recounts the story of how an 18th-century ancestor named Ma Paanza hid rice grains in her hair and brought them to the newly founded communities in the jungle. The Saamaka still grow a strain of rice called Ma Paanza. \u201c[Rice] is easy to cultivate. It was an ideal food for us then and until now,\u201d Aboikoni says. Now, centuries after escaping from the plantations, the Saamaka find their ancestral lands facing new threats, this time from climate breakdown. In 2022, Suriname bore the brunt of heavy rainfall due to the climate crisis and La Ni\u00f1a weather patterns, resulting in widespread flooding in the interior. In response to the mounting pressure from extreme rainfall on the Brokopondo reservoir in the middle of the country, the state-owned oil and gas company, Staatsolie, opened the sluices of the Afobaka dam, designed to supply electricity to the now-defunct industrial aluminium smelters of the US multinational Alcoa.

In response to the mounting pressure from extreme rainfall on the Brokopondo reservoir in the middle of the country, the state-owned oil and gas company, Staatsolie, opened the sluices of the Afobaka dam, designed to supply electricity to the now-defunct industrial aluminium smelters of the US multinational Alcoa.

{"text":"With a power plant humming away nearby, my first visit to the heart of Kenya\u2019s geothermal power generation turns out to be a lesson on what is going on below our feet. According to the Geological Society, the Somalian and Nubian tectonic plates pulled away in opposite directions about 25m years ago, with the surface between the two fault lines sinking and bringing magmatic fluids closer to Earth\u2019s surface and creating the famous rift, a vast valley that stretches 6,400km from Jordan to Mozambique. Under the valley, water percolates easily and comes into contact with hot rocks found 1-3km beneath the surface, creating a mix of superheated water and steam at 75% and 25% respectively, with temperatures averaging 300C (572F) and pressures of 1,000 PSI. These are, it turns out, the perfect conditions for generating geothermal energy. \u201cThis is the steam we are tapping to run the turbines that generate electricity. It is rough down there, and that is where we go,\u201d says Mangi. \u201cA dangerous but necessary mission.\u201d Mangi has observed the behaviour of the valley for 27 years and knows exactly where to drill a well that will yield geothermal power. \u201cKenya has developed the capacity for precision geoscientific studies that help us to identify potential areas to drill. Exploration and drilling are cost-intensive endeavours and investors don\u2019t want to go to a greenfield without confirmed viable resources,\u201d he

According to the Geological Society, the Somalian and Nubian tectonic plates pulled away in opposite directions about 25m years ago, with the surface between the two fault lines sinking and bringing magmatic fluids closer to Earth\u2019s surface and creating the famous rift, a vast valley that stretches 6,400km from Jordan to Mozambique. Under the valley, water percolates easily and comes into contact with hot rocks found 1-3km beneath the surface, creating a mix of superheated water and steam at 75% and 25% respectively, with temperatures averaging 300C (572F) and pressures of 1,000 PSI. These are, it turns out, the perfect conditions for generating geothermal energy. \u201cThis is the steam we are tapping to run the turbines that generate electricity. It is rough down there, and that is where we go,\u201d says Mangi. \u201cA dangerous but necessary mission.\u201d Mangi has observed the behaviour of the valley for 27 years and knows exactly where to drill a well that will yield geothermal power. \u201cKenya has developed the capacity for precision geoscientific studies that help us to identify potential areas to drill. Exploration and drilling are cost-intensive endeavours and investors don\u2019t want to go to a greenfield without confirmed viable resources,\u201d he says.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: geothermal energy, tectonic plates, rift, magmatic fluids, hot rocks, steam, turbines"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772440,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

Others are rethinking glass towers entirely, experimenting with exteriors that use wood, concrete or steel rods. Blurring lines between the indoors and outdoors, some architects are creating green roofs and facades, inviting birds to nest within the building. \u201cMany people think about bird-friendly design as yet another limitation on buildings, yet another requirement,\u201d said Dan Piselli, director of sustainability at the New York-based architecture firm FXCollaborative. \u201cBut there are so many design-forward buildings that perfectly exemplify that this doesn\u2019t have to limit your design, your freedom.\u201d How modern buildings put birds in danger For Deborah Laurel, principal in the firm Prendergast Laurel Architects, the realization came a couple of decades ago.

{"text":"Flexible, thin solar cells that are lightweight and portable may be a step closer to reality after Australian researchers claimed a new record for the amount of sunlight they can capture and turn into energy. While traditional solar panels are rigid and heavy, the lightweight solar cells are made by printing ink on to thin plastic films. \u201cIt\u2019s the best demonstration that this is a viable method of making the solar cells,\u201d said CSIRO\u2019s renewable energy systems group leader, Dr Anthony Chesman. The scientists, working in collaboration with researchers from four universities, claimed an efficiency record for fully roll-to-roll printed cells, in which all of the layers of the product were made using printing methods. For a small-scale device they achieved efficiency of 15.5% and for a larger device measuring 50cm sq they achieved efficiency of 11%. The results of the research have been published in the journal Nature Communications. Lead author and CSIRO\u2019s principal research scientist, Dr Doojin Vak, said the efficiencies were made possible by integrating machine learning into the production process. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cWe developed a system for rapidly producing and testing over 10,000 solar cells a day \u2013 something that would have been impossible to do manually,\u201d he said. Vak said the team\u2019s research had also removed the need for some expensive materials in production of the cells, such as gold, by using specialised carbon inks that could reduce production costs. The emerging technology still trails the efficiency of conventional silicon solar panels and its potential use in the market is still some years away.","meta":{"id":"australia-news/2024/mar/12/csiro-claims-new-record-for-energy-efficiency-in-lightweight-printed-solar-cells_0","publication_date":"2024-03-12T09:56:22Z"},"_input_hash":-177770985,"_task_hash":1122926665,"tokens":[{"text":"Flexible","start":0,"end":8,"id":0,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":8,"end":9,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"thin","start":10,"end":14,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"solar","start":15,"end":20,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"cells","start":21,"end":26,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":27,"end":31,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":32,"end":35,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"lightweight","start":36,"end":47,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":48,"end":51,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"portable","start":52,"end":60,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"may","start":61,"end":64,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":65,"end":67,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":68,"end":69,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"step","start":70,"end":74,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"closer","start":75,"end":81,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":82,"end":84,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"reality","start":85,"end":92,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"after","start":93,"end":98,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"Australian","start":99,"end":109,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"researchers","start":110,"end":121,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"claimed","start":122,"end":129,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":130,"end":131,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"new","start":132,"end":135,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"record","start":136,"end":142,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":143,"end":146,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":147,"end":150,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"amount","start":151,"end":157,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":158,"end":160,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"sunlight","start":161,"end":169,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"they","start":170,"end":174,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"can","start":175,"end":178,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"capture","start":179,"end":186,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":187,"end":190,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"turn","start":191,"end":195,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"into","start":196,"end":200,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"energy","start":201,"end":207,"id":35,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":207,"end":208,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"While","start":209,"end":214,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"traditional","start":215,"end":226,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"solar","start":227,"end":232,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"panels","start":233,"end":239,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":240,"end":243,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"rigid","start":244,"end":249,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":250,"end":253,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"heavy","start":254,"end":259,"id":44,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":259,"end":260,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":261,"end":264,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"lightweight","start":265,"end":276,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"solar","start":277,"end":282,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"cells","start":283,"end":288,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":289,"end":292,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"made","start":293,"end":297,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"by","start":298,"end":300,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"printing","start":301,"end":309,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"ink","start":310,"end":313,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":314,"end":316,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":317,"end":319,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"thin","start":320,"end":324,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"plastic","start":325,"end":332,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"films","start":333,"end":338,"id":59,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":338,"end":339,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"\u201c","start":340,"end":341,"id":61,"ws":false},{"text":"It","start":341,"end":343,"id":62,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":343,"end":345,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":346,"end":349,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"best","start":350,"end":354,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"demonstration","start":355,"end":368,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":369,"end":373,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"this","start":374,"end":378,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":379,"end":381,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":382,"end":383,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"viable","start":384,"end":390,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"method","start":391,"end":397,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":398,"end":400,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"making","start":401,"end":407,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":408,"end":411,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"solar","start":412,"end":417,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"cells","start":418,"end":423,"id":77,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":423,"end":424,"id":78,"ws":false},{"text":"\u201d","start":424,"end":425,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"said","start":426,"end":430,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"CSIRO","start":431,"end":436,"id":81,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":436,"end":438,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"renewable","start":439,"end":448,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"energy","start":449,"end":455,"id":84

While traditional solar panels are rigid and heavy, the lightweight solar cells are made by printing ink on to thin plastic films. \u201cIt\u2019s the best demonstration that this is a viable method of making the solar cells,\u201d said CSIRO\u2019s renewable energy systems group leader, Dr Anthony Chesman. The scientists, working in collaboration with researchers from four universities, claimed an efficiency record for fully roll-to-roll printed cells, in which all of the layers of the product were made using printing methods. For a small-scale device they achieved efficiency of 15.5% and for a larger device measuring 50cm sq they achieved efficiency of 11%. The results of the research have been published in the journal Nature Communications. Lead author and CSIRO\u2019s principal research scientist, Dr Doojin Vak, said the efficiencies were made possible by integrating machine learning into the production process. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cWe developed a system for rapidly producing and testing over 10,000 solar cells a day \u2013 something that would have been impossible to do manually,\u201d he said. Vak said the team\u2019s research had also removed the need for some expensive materials in production of the cells, such as gold, by using specialised carbon inks that could reduce production costs. The emerging technology still trails the efficiency of conventional silicon solar panels and its potential use in the market is still some years away.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: thin solar cells, lightweight solar cells, printing ink, thin plastic films, machine learning, carbon inks\nmethod: roll-to-roll printing, integrating machine learning, using carbon inks"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772478,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

majority.\u201d","meta":{"id":"politics/2024/feb/13/young-climate-activists-labour-candidate-selections-green-new-deal-rising_1","publication_date":"2024-02-13T15:22:06Z"},"_input_hash":991464076,"_task_hash":-1939926748,"tokens":[{"text":"\u201c","start":0,"end":1,"id":0,"ws":false},{"text":"Our","start":1,"end":4,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"organising","start":5,"end":15,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"programmes","start":16,"end":26,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":27,"end":30,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"getting","start":31,"end":38,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"ready","start":39,"end":44,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":45,"end":47,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"absorb","start":48,"end":54,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"thousands","start":55,"end":64,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":65,"end":67,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"young","start":68,"end":73,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"people","start":74,"end":80,"id":12,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":80,"end":81,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":82,"end":85,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"we","start":86,"end":88,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"said","start":89,"end":93,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":94,"end":96,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"Jamie","start":97,"end":102,"id":18,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019s","start":102,"end":104,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"instance","start":105,"end":113,"id":20,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":113,"end":114,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":115,"end":117,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":118,"end":122,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"campaign","start":123,"end":131,"id":24,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":131,"end":132,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"we","start":133,"end":135,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":136,"end":139,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"going","start":140,"end":145,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":146,"end":148,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"need","start":149,"end":153,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":154,"end":156,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"turn","start":157,"end":161,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"out","start":162,"end":165,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"60,000","start":166,"end":172,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"votes","start":173,"end":178,"id":35,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":178,"end":179,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"\u201c","start":180,"end":181,"id":37,"ws":false},{"text":"We","start":181,"end":183,"id":38,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019re","start":183,"end":186,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"talking","start":187,"end":194,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"big","start":195,"end":198,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"numbers","start":199,"end":206,"id":42,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":206,"end":207,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"but","start":208,"end":211,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"we","start":212,"end":214,"id":45,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019ve","start":214,"end":217,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"been","start":218,"end":222,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"working","start":223,"end":230,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":231,"end":233,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"this","start":234,"end":238,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":239,"end":242,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"building","start":243,"end":251,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":252,"end":255,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"sort","start":256,"end":260,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":261,"end":263,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"infrastructure","start":264,"end":278,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":279,"end":281,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":282,"end":284,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"able","start":285,"end":289,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":290,"end":292,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"scale","start":293,"end":298,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":299,"end":302,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":303,"end":306,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"last","start":307,"end":311,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"18","start":312,"end":314,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"months","start":315,"end":321,"id":66,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":321,"end":322,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"So","start":323,"end":325,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"we","start":326,"end":328,"id":69,"ws":false},{"text":"\u2019re","start":328,"end":331,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"ready","start":332,"end":337,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":338,"end":340,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"take","start":341,"end":345,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":346,"end":348,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"young","start":349,"end":354,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"people","start":355,"end":361,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"up","start":362,"end":364,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":365,"end":368,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"down","start":369,"end":373,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":374,"end":377,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"country","start":378,"end":385,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":386,"end":388,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"take","start":389,"end":393,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"those","start":394,"end":399,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"roles","start":400,"end

{"text":"BNG is regulated by several bodies, including local authorities and government agencies. This is seen a strength of the scheme, as it avoids the problem of \u201cmarking your own homework\u201d associated with voluntary markets. However, regulators lack the staff to check the pledged habitat benefits actually materialise. Zu Ermgassen was part of a study that found that more than a quarter of BNG units are at risk of leading to no tangible increases in biodiversity because there is no monitoring system in place. There are also concerns that there are too few ecologists to oversee habitats or score them correctly. Some may lack independence if they are employed by the developer. Tom Oliver, a professor of applied ecology at the University of Reading, said environmental regulations are typically let down by lax enforcement. \u201cBNG\u2019s success hinges on effective environmental regulation, monitoring and policing, and yet when you look at all our past case studies they clearly show a failure of environmental enforcement and policing,\u201d he said.

Zu Ermgassen was part of a study that found that more than a quarter of BNG units are at risk of leading to no tangible increases in biodiversity because there is no monitoring system in place. There are also concerns that there are too few ecologists to oversee habitats or score them correctly. Some may lack independence if they are employed by the developer.

This is simply the next step in Kingston Lacy\u2019s history and preservation.\u201d Griffith added: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found when we\u2019ve moved from fossil fuel conservation heating to heat pump conservation heating is that extending the heating time means that we have a longer duration of lower-grade heat coming into the building so it\u2019s a lot gentler.

Italian farmers also want the reinstatement of an income tax exemption scrapped in the government\u2019s 2024 budget. \u201cOur vehicles will converge around the capital,\u201d said Danilo Calvani, one of their leaders. \u201cNext week, there will be a big demonstration in Rome.\u201d In the financial hub of Milan, farmers paraded a cow during a demonstration outside the offices of the Lombardy regional government.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: move to a more sustainable model of production, explain grievances in a concrete, concise and unanimous way, revision of the European green deal, reinstatement of an income tax exemption\npolicy: European green deal\ntechnology: \nmethod: drastically reduce pesticides and fertilisers, attack on meat consumption"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772618,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"The book, out on 7 March and is aimed at older children (aged 9+) and adults, explains how and why Tree and her husband, Charlie Burrell, sold off their dairy cows and farm machinery in 2000. They stopped ploughing and spraying fertilisers and pesticides, pulled up their barbed wire fences, smashed their Victorian land drains, quit clearing their ditches \u2013 and \u201csimply let things go\u201d. \u201cWe wanted to work with nature for a change, rather than fighting against it all the time,\u201d writes Tree. Exquisite illustrations by the printmaker and fine artist Angela Harding reveal how, step-by-step, wilderness and wildlife then returned to Knepp. \u201cNature bounces back, if you let it, wherever it can.\u201d Some of the rarest creatures in Britain have now made Knepp their home, including kingfishers, hazel dormice, scarce chaser dragonflies and purple emperor butterflies. The river has returned to its natural course and the soil is now storing as much carbon per hectare as a 25-year-old plantation of trees does, according to recent tests. \u201cThat\u2019s really exciting, because rewilding has been seen as fantastic for wildlife and recovering biodiversity, but people say it doesn\u2019t answer the problem of climate change. We can say now, categorically, it does. That, actually, you can restore your soils by allowing an area to rewild \u2013 and just the soils alone will be the same as a carbon storage in a plantation.\u201d","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/25/rewilding-climate-change-biodiversity-isabella-tree-nature-planet-farming_1","publication_date":"2024-02-25T11:00:57Z"},"_input_hash":-829206429,"_task_hash":1789660022,"tokens":[{"text":"The","start":0,"end":3,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"book","start":4,"end":8,"id":1,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":8,"end":9,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"out","start":10,"end":13,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":14,"end":16,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"7","start":17,"end":18,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"March","start":19,"end":24,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":25,"end":28,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":29,"end":31,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"aimed","start":32,"end":37,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"at","start":38,"end":40,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"older","start":41,"end":46,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"children","start":47,"end":55,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":56,"end":57,"id":13,"ws":false},{"text":"aged","start":57,"end":61,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"9","start":62,"end":63,"id":15,"ws":false},{"text":"+","start":63,"end":64,"id":16,"ws":false},{"text":")","start":64,"end":65,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":66,"end":69,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"adults","start":70,"end":76,"id":19,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":76,"end":77,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"explains","start":78,"end":86,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"how","start":87,"end":90,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":91,"end":94,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"why","start":95,"end":98,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"Tree","start":99,"end":103,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":104,"end":107,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"her","start":108,"end":111,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"husband","start":112,"end":119,"id":28,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":119,"end":120,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"Charlie","start":121,"end":128,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"Burrell","start":129,"end":136,"id":31,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":136,"end":137,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"sold","start":138,"end":142,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"off","start":143,"end":146,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"their","start":147,"end":152,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"dairy","start":153,"end":158,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"cows","start":159,"end":163,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":164,"end":167,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"farm","start":168,"end":172,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"machinery","start":173,"end":182,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":183,"end":185,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"2000","start":186,"end":190,"id":42,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":190,"end":191,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"They","start":192,"end":196,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"stopped","start":197,"end":204,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"ploughing","start":205,"end":214,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":215,"end":218,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"spraying","start":219,"end":227,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"fertilisers","start":228,"end":239,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":240,"end":243,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"pesticides","start":244,"end":254,"id":51,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":254,"end":255,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":"pulled","start":256,"end":262,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"up","start":263,"end":265,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"their","start":266,"end":271,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"barbed","start":272,"end":278,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"wire","start":279,"end":283,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"fences","start":284,"end":290,"id":58,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":290,"end":291,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"smashed","start":292,"end":299,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"their","start":300,"end":305,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"Victorian","start":306,"end":315,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"land","start":316,"end":320,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"drains","start":321,"end":327,"id":64,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":327,"end":328,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"quit","start":329,"end":333,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"clearing","start":334,"end":342,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"their","start":343,"end":348,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"ditches","start":349,"end":356,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"\u2013","start":357,"end":358,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":359,"end":362,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"\u201c","start":363,"end":364,"id":72,"ws":false},{"text":"simply","start":364,"end":370,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"let","start":371,"end":374,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"things","start":375,"end":381,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"go","start":382,"end":384,"id":76,"ws":false},{"text":"\u201d","start":384,"end":385,"id":77,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":385,"end":386,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"\u201c","start":387,"end":388,"id":79,"ws":false},{"text":"We","start":388,"end":390,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"wanted","start":391,"end":397,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":398,"end":400,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"work","start":401,"end":405,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":406,"end":410,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"nature","start":411,"end":

Carlo Buontempo, a CCCS director, said: \u201cThe extremes we have observed over the last few months provide a dramatic testimony of how far we now are from the climate in which our civilisation developed. \u201cThis has profound consequences for the Paris agreement and all human endeavours. If we want to successfully manage our climate risk, we need to urgently decarbonise our economy whilst using climate data and knowledge to prepare for the future.\u201d Scientists said recently that the Earth\u2019s life support systems have been so damaged that the planet was \u201cwell outside the safe operating space for humanity\u201d. Samantha Burgess, the CCCS deputy director, said: \u201c2023 was an exceptional year, with climate records tumbling like dominoes. Temperatures during 2023 likely exceed those of any period in at least the last 100,000 years.\u201d Prof Bill Collins, at the University of Reading, UK, said: \u201cIt is a shock that 2023 unarguably smashed the global temperature record.

Carlo Buontempo, a CCCS director, said: \u201cThe extremes we have observed over the last few months provide a dramatic testimony of how far we now are from the climate in which our civilisation developed. \u201cThis has profound consequences for the Paris agreement and all human endeavours. If we want to successfully manage our climate risk, we need to urgently decarbonise our economy whilst using climate data and knowledge to prepare for the future.\u201d Scientists said recently that the Earth\u2019s life support systems have been so damaged that the planet was \u201cwell outside the safe operating space for humanity\u201d. Samantha Burgess, the CCCS deputy director, said: \u201c2023 was an exceptional year, with climate records tumbling like dominoes. Temperatures during 2023 likely exceed those of any period in at least the last 100,000 years.\u201d Prof Bill Collins, at the University of Reading, UK, said: \u201cIt is a shock that 2023 unarguably smashed the global temperature record. More global warming is expected to cause even wetter winters in the UK and yet more flooding.\u201d The CCCS highlighted a number of \u201cremarkable\u201d events in 2023, including huge blazes in Canada that helped drive up global carbon emissions from wildfires by 30%, and unprecedented ocean temperatures that caused marine heatwaves to strike many regions.\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: decarbonise our economy, prepare for the future\npolicy: Paris agreement\ntechnology: climate data\nmethod: urgently decarbonise our economy, using climate data and knowledge"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772638,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
{"text":"In an email to Environment Agency (EA) officials sent last February, the foundation said drainage water from the farms was \u201ca pollution risk and should not be directed to watercourses\u201d. It added that the issue was \u201cvery common and one that we have found very difficult to address\u201d. The charity was seeking guidance as to how the runoff should be treated. It is working with farmers to improve protection of the catchment area from effluent and agricultural drainage water. Simon Evans, chief executive of the foundation, said: \u2018Many of the challenges we are trying to resolve are the legacy of historic poor planning decisions, such as when the planners have insisted the units be located too close to watercourses. \u201cIn some cases, the solutions are not obvious and require careful consideration along with guidance from regulators. Noble has been actively engaged in helping to find and fund solutions on the farms that supply them, and their support is driving the progress that is being made to resolve the issues.\u201d River Action is seeking a judicial review of the EA over allegations it had failed to protect the Wye from agricultural pollution. It is claimed the agency has failed to prevent the spreading of excess organic manure or properly apply the rules. Ricardo Gama, a solicitor at Leigh Day, which is representing River Action in the judicial review, due to be heard next month at the high court in Cardiff, said: \u201cRiver Action\u2019s ultimate goal is that the agency takes a strong hand and actually starts enforcing these

Simon Evans, chief executive of the foundation, said: \u2018Many of the challenges we are trying to resolve are the legacy of historic poor planning decisions, such as when the planners have insisted the units be located too close to watercourses. \u201cIn some cases, the solutions are not obvious and require careful consideration along with guidance from regulators.

It is claimed the agency has failed to prevent the spreading of excess organic manure or properly apply the rules. Ricardo Gama, a solicitor at Leigh Day, which is representing River Action in the judicial review, due to be heard next month at the high court in Cardiff, said: \u201cRiver Action\u2019s ultimate goal is that the agency takes a strong hand and actually starts enforcing these rules.\u201d\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: improve protection of the catchment area from effluent and agricultural drainage water, find and fund solutions on the farms\npolicy: \ntechnology: drainage water, runoff, agricultural pollution, excess organic manure"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772657,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}

For example, 'solar panels' or 'electric vehicles'.\n\n\nBelow are some examples (only use these as a guide):\n\nText:\n'''\nSunrise, the new solar panel project, is expected to be completed by 2022.\n'''\n\nproject: Sunrise\ninitiative: \npolicy: \ntechnology: solar panel\n\nText:\n'''\nadvances in soil science, like leveraging microorganisms for rejuvenation, are being used to improve crop yields.\n'''\n\nproject: \ninitiative: improve crop yields, leveraging microorganisms for rejuvenation\npolicy: \ntechnology: \n\nText:\n'''\nThe commission discussed Kigali Amendment on HFCs, a controversial climate policy which was met with mixed reviews.\n'''\n\nproject: \ninitiative: \npolicy: Kigali Amendment on HFCs\ntechnology: \n\n\nHere is the text that needs labeling:\n\nText:\n'''\nIf Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour wins the next UK general election, Chaudhary has \u201cvery little hope\u201d this will mean \u201cany appreciable change for climate issues\u201d, he says. Leftwing climate realists must think outside of the box, \u201cnot only to influence major parties\u201d but to build networks of people and groups beyond these traditional political spaces. Emotions can help with this because they are how people \u201crelate to the world\u201d, he says. But aside from ecoanxiety (an overwhelming disquiet about environmental crisis) and solastalgia (the distress caused by the environmental changes where you live, causing a kind of homesickness), how we feel, a more \u201cinchoate\u201d sense of exhaustion, is missing from a lot of climate texts, he says. \u201cI might feel exhaustion in a particular way \u2013 like burnout, that\u2019s very common for someone in my social position in a place like the United States,\u201d Chaudhary explains, \u201cbut someone else might be feeling it as pure bodily fatigue [and] someone else might be feeling it as \u2018my people have never had a chance to express ourselves\u2019.\u201d Tapping into this can unite people, he says. This makes a lot of sense. But halfway through reading Exhausted of the Earth, I wonder whether it could also be demobilising? If we\u2019re uniting over how exhausted we are, might we end up deciding we\u2019re too exhausted to do anything about it?\n'''"],"response":["project: \ninitiative: think outside of the box, build networks of people and groups\npolicy: \ntechnology: ecoanxiety, solastalgia"]},"_view_id":"spans_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710772714,"_annotator_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01","_session_id":"2024-03-18_10-59-01"}
