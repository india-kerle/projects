The US ski industry has lost more than $5bn over the past two decades due to human-caused global heating, the new research has calculated, due to the increasingly sparse nature of snowfall on mountain ranges. Previous studies have shown that in many locations precipitation is now coming in the form of rain, rather than snow, due to warming temperatures. This situation, the new study states, has shortened the average ski season in the US by five to seven days over the past half century, costing the industry an average of $252m a year from lost revenue and the rising cost of making snow via machines. \u201cWe are probably past the era of peak ski seasons,\u201d said Daniel Scott, a scientist at the University of Waterloo in Canada, who undertook the research with colleagues at the University of Innsbruck. \u201cClimate change is an evolving business reality for the ski industry and the tourism sector.\u201d Unusually warm winters for parts of the US, as well as ski resorts in Europe, have illustrated the mounting problems facing the pastime.

In the US, sites across the western half of the country have reported less than half the normal snowpack, causing resorts to scramble into greater snow production or scale back their offering to skiers. \u201cThe record-breaking temperatures this winter provided a preview of the future,\u201d Scott said.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/02/ski-resorts-snow-global-warming-study_0","publication_date":"2024-03-02T13:30:31Z"}}

Vast areas of this unexplored abyss, particularly in the Pacific Ocean, are littered with polymetallic nodules, rich in manganese, nickel, copper, cobalt and other trace minerals. Minerals are also found near hydrothermal vents and within seamounts (underwater mountains). Why is there a growing interest in deep-sea mining? The race to cut carbon emissions to combat global heating has led to a soaring demand for copper, cobalt, nickel and other ingredients needed for the energy transition. In 2040, the world\u2019s need for many of these metals, used for electric vehicle batteries, solar panels and wind turbines, will be twice what it is today, according to the International Energy Agency.

Making landfall on Friday afternoon as a category one Cyclone, Lincoln maintained its strength into the evening before being downgraded to a tropical low or ex-tropical cyclone (Ex-TC). By Saturday morning, 202mm of rain had fallen over 24 hours at Centre Island, located to the north-east of Borroloola and nearby to where Lincoln made landfall. The Ex-TC then slowly tracked westwards across the Northern Territory as it brought heavy rainfall and damaging wind gusts to a series of districts. Warnings of flash flooding were issued by the BOM for a series of northern districts in the Northern Territory, with rainfall totals of 60-100mm forecast to fall within a six-hour period; 80-140mm expected over the 24-hour period. Tennant Creek, located in the west of the Barkly district, recorded 138.4mm of rain within 24 hours by Sunday morning. A further warning for locally intense rainfall and life-threatening flash flooding was issued for the these districts, with six-hourly totals of up to 150mm possible near the centre and southern side of the Ex-TC, and 24-hourly totals of up to 220mm possible. Ex-TC Lincoln is forecast to arrive into Western Australia by late Monday, passing across the Kimberley region before heading into the Indian Ocean by the middle of this week, where there is a high probability for the system to regenerate and return to its tropical cyclone status. Lincoln was the third cyclone of the season, which runs from November to April, following on from Cyclone Kirrily at the start of the month and Cyclone Jasper in mid-December.

PFAS are added to cosmetics to smooth the skin, or to make cosmetic products more durable, spreadable and water resistant. They are a class of about 14,000 chemicals often used to make products resistant to water, stains and heat and are called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they are virtually indestructible. An increasing international body of evidence is linking PFAS with cancers, birth defects and negative effects on the immune systems of humans and animals. The chemicals have been detected in drinking water sources, sea foam and spray, rain and groundwater, sea ice, and human blood and are found in cosmetics such as shaving cream and lipstick, as well as Teflon pans and pizza boxes. The EPA said that although the chemicals were found in a small number of cosmetic products, it was taking a precautionary approach to any potential risks. The cosmetic ban is part of a wider response to protect against the chemicals, including testing for background levels of PFAS in the environment, and phasing out PFAS-firefighting foams. \u201cWe know these chemicals don\u2019t easily break down, they can build up in our bodies, and some can be toxic at high levels,\u201d said Dr Shaun Presow, the EPA\u2019s hazardous substances reassessments manager.

The increase is a boost for the automotive industry after the pandemic led to supply chain problems and a shortage of vital computer chips that slowed production. Across the year, 315,000 new battery electric vehicles were sold. That was 50,000 more than 2022, but the number being bought as a share of total registrations failed to grow as expected.

The lacklustre growth in the electric vehicle market comes despite a government goal to totally phase out petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles by 2035, albeit one that was diluted by Rishi Sunak last September from an original target of 2030. The changeover is being supported by the zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate, which will require 22% of all vehicles manufactured by carmakers to be ZEVs by the start of next year, with this rising to 80% by 2030.

The discovery was made by University of Exeter scientists who found that females whose chrysalises developed at 11C had six spots on average, while those developing at 15C had just three. The findings may challenge lepidopterists\u2019 long-held views about why butterflies have varying numbers of spots. The meadow brown, a common midsummer butterfly found on grasslands across Europe, has large eyespots on its forewings that are believed to startle and alarm predators.

Prof Richard ffrench-Constant, from Exeter\u2019s Centre for Ecology and Conservation and co-author of the study, said: \u201cOur findings show that fewer of these hindwing spots appear when females experience higher temperatures during their pupal stage (in a chrysalis before emerging as a butterfly). \u201cThis suggests the butterflies adapt their camouflage based on the conditions. For example, with fewer spots they may be harder to spot on dry, brown grass that would be more common in hot weather. \u201cWe did not observe such a strong effect in males, possibly because their spots are important for sexual selection.\u201d","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/18/meadow-brown-butterflies-adapt-to-global-heating-by-developing-fewer-spots_0","publication_date":"2024-01-18T05:00:03Z"}}

{"text":"The British body that certifies food in the UK as organic has been accused of misleading consumers over its labelling of Scottish farmed salmon. Thirty charities, conservation and community organisations, including WildFish, the Pesticide Action Network and Blue Marine Foundation, say the negative environmental impacts of the industry in Scotland \u201crun completely counter\u201d to the principles of the Soil Association\u2019s promotion of healthy, humane and sustainable food. In an open letter to the association, which plans to update its organic fish farming standards, the groups call for the removal of its certification of Scottish salmon and trout farms, as \u201cunacceptable greenwashing of an unsustainable industry\u201d. In December, the broadcaster and presenter Chris Packham called for a halt to the growth of salmon farms in Scotland, as official figures suggested farmed salmon mortality had hit record levels in 2023. Packham, the president of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), said the industry was \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for fish welfare and Scotland\u2019s environment. Salmon farms certified as organic by the Soil Association are required to show how they will minimise their impact on the aquatic environment, and maintain lower population densities than those required by other standards, including the RSPCA standard. Rachel Mulrenan, WildFish\u2019s Scotland director, said: \u201cSo-called \u2018organic\u2019 Scottish salmon is a misnomer.

The controversy has been covered for years in local and national news outlets, including a civil rights case Eaton\u2019s group filed \u2013 and lost \u2013 to close the landfill. Just last year, coal ash in the state drew national attention when the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tentatively denied a state clean-up proposal that it found to be too weak for waste coming in part from its largest electricity provider \u2013 Alabama Power. But neither the news from Uniontown, nor the EPA rejection, ever appeared in the Birmingham Times \u2013 a historic African American newspaper \u2013 or on the online-only Alabama News Center, an investigation by Floodlight found. A search for \u201ccoal ash\u201d in the Birmingham Times yields just one reprinted story from HuffPost, and it\u2019s a reference to coal ash in another state. Both news outlets have financial ties to the main subject of those stories, Alabama Power.

The findings are backed up by a number of separate studies, all from well-regarded energy authorities, which paint a picture of a world at the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era. An analysis of China\u2019s carbon emissions \u2013 the highest in the world and more than the emissions of the US, India and Russia combined \u2013 found that they may reach a peak this year before falling into a structural decline by 2024. The study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, undertaken for Carbon Brief, found that China\u2019s rollout of wind and solar power had been faster than expected this year and could eclipse the country\u2019s growing energy appetite. A peak in China\u2019s emissions this year was also found by Climate Analytics, a climate policy institute, which predicted that an emissions peak for the world\u2019s most energy-hungry nation could drive the world to an emissions \u201ctipping point\u201d in 2023.

These concern sewage pollution in rivers and seas, protection for habitats of endangered animals, food waste, electronic waste, fast fashion, \u201cforever chemicals\u201d, ozone-depleting substances, extracting rare minerals, regulating dangerous particulate pollution, and reducing emissions from intensive farming.

We are increasingly seeing a trend towards the EU improving environmental laws and the UK not following suit. In some areas, there is a real danger of us going backwards. \u201cThis backsliding is problematic because not only will it weaken existing levels of environmental protection, our trade and cooperation agreement with the EU has a specific legal commitment, repeated by multiple ministers, that the UK would retain high standards and not regress after Brexit.\u201d In Northern Ireland, the situation is even more complex, as under the protocol it has to keep some EU-derived environmental laws. While this means there is technically more protection from chemical pollution and nature destruction, the differences in regulation between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK have implications for trade and politics.

March is typically the hottest time of the year for oceans because it is late summer in the southern hemisphere, which is home to most of the world\u2019s great seas.

A strong El Ni\u00f1o has pushed temperatures higher, but Francesca Guglielmo, a Copernicus senior scientist, noted this was only one of several heating factors that worked in combination. Every extra tonne of carbon dioxide emitted by humanity increases pressure on the oceans. In some areas, the anomalous heat has also been intensified by weak trade winds, a lethargic jet stream, fluctuations in North Atlantic circulation and reductions in aerosol pollution, which exposes more of the ocean to the sun. Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist for The Nature Conservancy, said the uncertainty about the interaction of the different factors was a reminder that we do not fully understand every aspect of how the complex Earth system is responding to unprecedented radiative forcing. \u201cThis is happening at a much faster rate than ever documented in the past,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anything, we are much more likely to underestimate the impact of those changes on human society than to overestimate them.\u201d","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/17/february-on-course-to-break-unprecedented-number-of-heat-records_2","publication_date":"2024-02-17T06:00:06Z"}}

Azerbaijan owns one of the world\u2019s largest gasfields, Shah Deniz in the Caspian Sea, and the country is expected to extract 411bcm of gas over the next 10 years, according to data sourced by the campaign group Global Witness from analysts at Rystad Energy.

The extreme drought of 2023 would be expected about once every 50 years in today\u2019s climate, the analysis estimated. But if global heating reaches 2C, such a severe drought would be expected every 13 years. The scientists said the large-scale destruction of the rainforest for beef and soy production in recent decades had worsened the drought because the clearing of the vegetation means the land retains less water. Recent data shows that the Amazon rainforest is approaching a tipping point, after which the rainforest would be lost with profound implications for the global climate and biodiversity. More than 75% of the untouched forest has lost stability since the early 2000s, the study showed, meaning it takes longer to recover after droughts and wildfires.

Atmospheric rivers are long narrow channels of very moist air that flow through the atmosphere, transporting impressive amounts of water vapour that eventually fall as heavy rain or snow. The pineapple express is a famous recurring atmospheric river that forms near the Hawaiian Islands and flows north-east to the Pacific coast of North America. After the initial storm during 31 January and 1 February, the second moved in between 4 and 6 February, both bringing persistent heavy rain across much of California and dumping snow on mountains. The area between Santa Barbara and San Diego was particularly badly affected, with several places setting new rainfall records for the date or month. Downtown Los Angeles had received 10.57in of rainfall by 7 February, almost three times the February average, and 74% of the typical yearly rainfall. A state of emergency was declared in several counties as widespread flash flooding occurred. In the hills of Los Angeles and San Francisco mudslides swept away buildings and cars, while coastal cliffs collapsed in Santa Barbara county and part of a major road was washed away in the Mojave desert.

The Norfolk hawker, known for its bright green eyes and golden body, went extinct from the Cambridgeshire Fens in 1893 and became confined to east Norfolk and east Suffolk. It is thought this was caused by the draining of its preferred habitat of ponds and marshes for agriculture over the centuries. It has since been almost entirely restricted to the Norfolk Broads. In recent years, however, the dragonfly has been found in Cambridgeshire, Kent and Herefordshire. The populations at these locations have become stable, and scientists have declared that due to its wider population spread and the appearance of strongholds across parts of the country, it is no longer endangered. The species was spotted near Wigan in June 2022, the first time it had been recorded there. It has also been recorded in Bolton and Blackpool, as well as south Devon, Dorset and Sussex.

{"text":"There have been more than 1,000 huge leaks of the potent greenhouse gas methane from landfill waste dumps since 2019, the Guardian can reveal. Analysis of global satellite data from around the world shows the populous nations of south Asia are a hotspot for these super-emitter events, as well as Argentina and Spain, developed countries where proper waste management should prevent leaks. Landfills emit methane when organic waste such as food scraps, wood, card, paper and garden waste decompose in the absence of oxygen. Methane, also called natural gas, traps 86 times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over 20 years, making it a critical target for climate action. Scientists have said emissions from unmanaged landfills could double by 2050 as urban populations grow, blowing the chance of avoiding climate catastrophe. A total of 1,256 methane super-emitter events occurred between January 2019 and June 2023, according to the new data. Pakistan, India and Bangladesh lead the list of nations with the most large leaks, followed by Argentina, Uzbekistan and Spain. Landfill emissions can be reduced by creating less organic waste in the first place, diverting it away from landfill, or at least capturing some of the methane that is being released from the landfills. Action to stem methane leaks slows global heating faster than almost any other measure and is often low-cost, with some measures even paying for themselves when the captured gas is sold as fuel. Methane emissions have accelerated since 2007 and cause a third of the global heating driving the climate crisis today.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/12/revealed-the-1200-big-methane-leaks-from-waste-dumps-trashing-the-planet_0","publication_date":"2024-02-12T12:00:13Z"}}

{"text":"Ministers need to intervene to boost the secondhand electric vehicle market and allay \u201cuncertainty and concerns\u201d over the health of their batteries, a House of Lords committee has said. Peers on the environment and climate change committee urged the government to step up efforts to encourage electric vehicle adoption amid consumer jitters over the cost of vehicles, the longevity of their batteries and the availability of charging points. Ministers should step in to tackle the disparity in upfront costs between EVs and petrol and diesel cars, and examine targeted grants to incentivise the purchase of electric cars, they said in a report. During their seven-month long inquiry, witnesses repeatedly called for a cross-industry battery health testing standard to provide \u201cclear information and reassurance to consumers\u201d. The study raised concerns over the secondhand market as most vehicles available for resale are sports utility vehicles (SUVs) or cars costing more than \u00a340,000 sold on by businesses and early adopters of EVs, meaning they are \u201cout of reach of most consumers\u201d. The peers said grants should be awarded to bring down costs to make the purchases cheaper and stimulating an \u201caffordable\u201d market, before the subsidies are then tapered away when electric- and fossil fuel-powered cars reach the same price. There were 35.1m cars on UK roads in 2022, of which 650,000 were pure electric, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said on Monday, as the all-time number of electric cars sold in the UK passed 1m.

Akshat Rathi, a climate reporter with financial news outlet Bloomberg, argues that smart policies can harness capitalism to cut carbon pollution without killing markets or competition. \u201cIt is now cheaper to save the world than destroy it,\u201d he writes, adding that this holds true even when viewed through a narrow capitalist lens. \u201cCapitalism cannot be the solution to climate change,\u201d Rathi told the Guardian. \u201cBut there can be a form of capitalism that we have seen working \u2013 in many different parts of the world, in big and small ways \u2013 that if we can use and deploy in other parts of the world, we really can use this tool to the advantage it provides us.\u201d In Climate Capitalism, Rathi runs through stories of success and failure that have helped people invent clean technologies, develop them into profitable products and build them at scale. His search takes him from an industrial park in Fujian, China\u2019s electric battery capital, to a vast solar plant on former farmland in Pavagada, a drought-stricken region in India, to drill-scarred fields that may soon store carbon in Texas, the heart of the oil and gas industry in the US. In each case, he says, capitalist systems are being moulded to push money and people away from pollution. In the US, the government passed the Inflation Reduction Act to throw money at clean technologies. In Europe, where support for climate action is broader, the EU has been able to punish polluters as well as subsidise clean alternatives \u2013 though with less money and more bureaucracy than in the US.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/15/cheaper-to-save-the-world-than-destroy-it-why-capitalism-is-going-green_0","publication_date":"2024-01-15T15:00:32Z"}}

{"text":"Tightening environmental standards for British farmers while importing food produced to lower standards risks making eco-friendly food an unaffordable luxury item, farmers have said. At the Oxford Farming Conference on Thursday, the environment secretary, Steve Barclay, announced that the government would consult on a new labelling scheme that would single out food produced to UK standards, allowing consumers to choose more environmentally friendly food. Barclay also announced a rise in new post-Brexit environmental farming payments, aimed at encouraging more farmers to make nature-friendly choices on their land. However, farmers and retailers fear that raising environmental standards in the UK while importing from countries with lower standards will cause British farmers to be undercut and pushed out of business, and high quality British food to be an expensive luxury. Joe Stanley, a farmer and chair of the Leicestershire branch of the National Farmers\u2019 Union, said of the labelling policy: \u201cIt\u2019d be easier to get more excited about this were it coming from a government which hadn\u2019t made it a guiding principle of trade policy since 2016 to source the cheapest, most environmentally damaging produce from wherever it could be found, undercutting UK farm standards.\u201d Since Brexit, the government has struck deals with Australia, Mexico and Canada, raising fears meat such as pork and beef produced to lower animal welfare and environmental standards will be imported into the UK. A report launched at the conference, written by the retail expert Ged Futter, says cheap imports risk putting sustainable British farms at a disadvantage. The report states: \u201cThere is a belief from UK retailers that there is a sea of plenty out there and if they lose a UK grower, they can just replace it with an import.\u201d Last year, a UK egg market collapse meant Polish eggs flooded the market. Growers cited in the report say the government has not supported them in reaching environmental and net zero targets, which \u201ctied the growers\u2019 hands behind their backs straight away so we can\u2019t compete\u201d with countries that produce cheaper food to lower standards.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/04/uk-farmers-say-tighter-environmental-rules-put-them-at-risk-of-being-undercut_0","publication_date":"2024-01-04T12:47:18Z"}}
{"text":"Long-range weather predictions are notoriously difficult, but a new paper in the journal Weather and Climate Dynamics suggests that the melt rate of the Greenland ice sheet can predict the next summer\u2019s weather in Europe. The chain of events is complex and other factors may interfere. But according to Dr Marilena Oltmanns of the UK National Oceanography Centre, lead author of the study, it goes roughly as follows: Warm conditions in Greenland bring more glacial meltwater into the Atlantic. Being lighter than seawater, this meltwater sits on top of the ocean and reduces the heat exchange between the air and the sea. This leads to stronger winds around the meltwater region. In winter, the winds produce a northward shift in the North Atlantic current, an extension of the Gulf Stream. The next summer, winds follow the direction of the current and are redirected northward. This helps form the type of large-scale atmospheric circulation conditions that bring warmer and drier weather over Europe. Oltmanns says the location, extent and strength of freshwater events can be used to estimate the subsequent pattern of warm and dry weather over Europe. \u201cBased on the identified chain of events, we expect that the ocean-atmosphere conditions will be favourable for an unusually warm and dry summer over southern Europe this year,\u201d says Oltmanns.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/14/melt-rate-greenland-ice-sheet-can-predict-summer-weather-in-europe-scientist-says_0","publication_date":"2024-03-14T06:00:12Z"}}

The report highlights that forests host 80% of the world\u2019s terrestrial biodiversity, support the livelihoods of 1.6 billion people and provide vital ecosystem services to support local and global economies. Deforestation contributes 11% of global carbon emissions. A study by the RSPB and WWF found that UK imports of just seven forest-risk commodities \u2013 soya, cocoa, palm oil, beef and leather, paper, rubber and timber \u2013 accounted for a land footprint of 88% of the size of the UK each year. In the same study, research showed that 40% of the UK\u2019s overseas land footprint was in countries at high risk of deforestation, weak governance arrangements and poor labour standards. The report also asks the government to bring in legislation to ensure all forest-risk goods bought by public bodies are certified as sustainable and not driving deforestation in sensitive areas. This would ensure that the UK government is not itself buying goods that are linked to unsustainable deforestation, and set an example for other industries. It has asked for the UK timber regulations to ensure that all imported timber is sustainably harvested, rather than just preventing illegally harvested timber from entering the country. MPs expressed alarm at the risks faced by the Indigenous people who protect many at-risk forests across the globe.

{"text":"More toxic air pollution has been averted by London\u2019s ultra-low emission zones than is produced by the capital\u2019s airports or its river and rail transport combined, according to a new analysis of the effects of the Ulez. The report showed that improvements in air quality between 2019 and 2022 from lowering motor vehicle pollution \u2013 even before the expansion of the Ulez throughout the capital since August \u2013 rivalled the potential savings from entirely cleaning up London\u2019s aviation or industrial and commercial heat and power generation. City Hall said the report, commissioned from Logika Group Air Quality Consultants using Transport for London data, showed the effectiveness of Ulez policies in tacking pollution and underlined the reasons for extending the zone to cover the whole of London, as of 29 August. Motorists must pay \u00a312.50 a day to drive a non-compliant car \u2013 typically a diesel more than seven years old or a petrol car more than 17 years old \u2013 in the Ulez, which covered a small central zone when launched in 2019 and was expanded to inner boroughs in 2021. The report found that the Ulez and the pre-existing low-emission zone for HGVs reduced road traffic particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions by 180 tonnes across London over three years, a cut exceeding the particulate pollution produced by rail and river transport and agriculture combined. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from road traffic fell by an estimated 13,500 tonnes in London in the same period \u2013 which the report says was a figure roughly equivalent to the emissions produced by planes taking off and landing at London Heathrow and City airports. The figures are estimates and do not cover the period since the Ulez expanded throughout London. The first official data since the latest expansion showed that the number of older, more polluting vehicles in London had dropped by nearly half in a month, with an average 95% of vehicles driven in the city now compliant and not subject to a fee. Early data suggested TfL was netting \u00a31m a day in charges and fines, although the scheme was not designed to raise revenue in the long term. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: \u201cThe decision to expand the Ulez was not something I took lightly but, when confronted by the evidence, it was clear that clean air zones like these are the most effective way to cut toxic air and meaningfully protect people\u2019s health.","meta":{"id":"environment/2023/dec/28/london-ulez-averts-more-air-pollution-than-that-caused-by-capitals-airports-report-shows_0","publication_date":"2023-12-28T14:00:36Z"}}

{"text":"The oil firm Shell cannot be allowed to withdraw from the Niger delta before it takes responsibility for its toxic legacy of pollution and the safe decommissioning of abandoned oil infrastructure, a report says. Shell plc is preparing to divest from the delta but a report warns that it must remain until it has cleaned up its legacy of pollution. The report, by the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (Somo), says historical pollution remains a serious issue in the area and accuses Shell of trying to avoid responsibility despite the billions of dollars it has earned from the oil. The allegations come as the Labour MP Clive Lewis said in the House of Commons that the departure of Shell, a British company, from the delta raised serious concerns that its environmental responsibilities and obligations could be evaded. The report says there is a big transparency gap around the issue of funding for decommissioning. Nigeria has legal requirements for companies to set aside funds for decommissioning, but there is no means to establish how much funding companies have \u2013 or have not \u2013 set aside, the report said. Researchers for Somo could not find any confirmation that Shell has set up a fund or funds to cover the decommissioning of the oil mining leases it has sold. \u201cShell has pulled off the ultimate Houdini act,\u201d said Audrey Gaughran, the executive director of Somo. \u201cAs the oil industry enters its final phase, whether that\u2019s in the next five years or 25, Shell has sold its toxic assets and will not be left holding them when the music stops. \u201cShell has profited from oil extraction for decades, and in doing so, has made the Niger delta one of the most oil-polluted places on Earth, leaving communities to face the dire consequences that will remain well beyond the lifetime of the industry.\u201d","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/28/shell-must-clean-up-pollution-before-it-leaves-niger-delta-report-says_0","publication_date":"2024-02-28T06:00:29Z"}}

{"text":"A picturesque expanse of water along Florida\u2019s space coast is offering a modicum of hope for the state\u2019s embattled manatees as wildlife officials review whether to restore the beloved sea cows to the endangered species list. The recovery of seagrass, the manatees\u2019 favorite food, in Mosquito Lagoon means that an emergency hand-feeding program that has kept many of the starving aquatic animals alive over the last two winters can be discontinued, at least temporarily. While scientists say this might be only a small step in the wider fight to rescue a species that has seen a record die-off in recent years from water pollution and habitat loss, what\u2019s happened at Mosquito Lagoon offers signposts to how the manatees\u2019 battle for survival might ultimately be won. \u201cAt least in a portion of the lagoon, we are seeing a rather rapid resurgence of the Halodule variety of seagrass that, even if we don\u2019t know exactly how it happened, does tell us that it\u2019s much more resilient than we might have been thinking,\u201d said Dennis Hanisak, a professor of marine botany at Florida Atlantic University\u2019s Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, and director of its seagrass nursery. \u201cIf Mosquito Lagoon can make a turnaround as quickly as it did, if somehow whatever happened there could happen in the rest of the northern Indian River Lagoon, that would be really, truly good news indeed.\u201d Hanisak and his team, in partnership with the Florida fish and wildlife commission (FWC), have focused their restoration efforts on the lagoon in northern Brevard county, one of the most popular feeding grounds for manatees during the colder winter months. That\u2019s where the majority of manatee deaths, an unprecedented 1,100 in Florida in 2021, 10% of the population, and another 800 in 2022, occurred. They were part of what federal and state authorities classify as an ongoing unusual mortality event (UME) with the majority of fatalities through malnutrition and starvation, a reflection of the loss of about 90% of the lagoon\u2019s seagrass to algae blooms and pollutants. It\u2019s too early to say exactly what role the seagrass nursery project has had there; Hanisak says it has ramped up in size and resources in recent years as wildlife agencies respond to the disaster with improved funding. It\u2019s one of several projects underway in Florida (a similar initiative at Brevard zoo was launched as part of its \u201crestore our shores\u201d effort) in which a diverse range of seagrass varieties are cultivated for research and transplant.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/04/manatees-florida-seagrass-endangered_0","publication_date":"2024-01-04T13:00:06Z"}}

Testing of 11 types of baggies made by major producers showed high levels of a marker of PFAS in nine. The analysis, conducted by an Environmental Protection Agency-certified lab and commissioned by the Mamavation blog, is the latest to highlight the use of PFAS in the nation\u2019s food packaging. US Food and Drug Administration rules allow much higher levels of some individual PFAS compounds in plastic than what the testing found, but the FDA is working off \u201coutdated science\u201d and the baggies present a health threat, said Maricel Maffini, a researcher with the Environmental Defense Fund who tracks PFAS in food. \u201cThe more we look into PFAS, the more we know there is not a safe level, and the [FDA\u2019s limits] don\u2019t correspond with the science and knowledge we have of these chemicals,\u201d she said. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 15,000 chemicals often used to make products resistant to water, stains and heat. They are called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down, and are linked to cancer, liver problems, thyroid issues, birth defects, kidney disease, decreased immunity and other serious health problems. Contaminated food represents the main exposure route to PFAS, though most regulatory attention has focused on water. The FDA has faced criticism from independent scientists who say it is failing to protect the public from concerning levels of PFAS found in a range of foods. Packaging is a major source of contamination.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/14/plastic-sandwich-bags-pfas-chemicals_0","publication_date":"2024-03-14T14:00:21Z"}}

If that doesn\u2019t also include social and environmental responsibility, then strategies like recycling or composting will always be the first to get cut when money is scarce, because they\u2019re not seen as core to the organization\u2019s mission. Pollans also said that cities with successful composting programs \u201chave a lot more public buy-in\u201d, transparency and incentives for citizens to participate in, like charging residents higher rates for sending more waste to a landfill, and lower rates if they divert more into composting or recycling streams. New York City council member Sandy Nurse, herself a former community composting organization founder and up until January the sanitation committee chair, says that New York could actually save money if it could get enough residents to participate in composting programs, due to economies of scale (sending trash to a landfill currently costs the city about $495m a year, she said). She\u2019s also looking at passing bills that could help make community composting organizations more financially resilient in the future. One would make public land available to composting organizations for free or for a very low cost, which could make a real dent in operating costs. Another would allow grassroots groups to sell their own compost, which they have historically been prohibited from doing if they\u2019re operating on public land. (They typically give it away for free to community gardens, parks and other groups.) Neither of these initiatives would save community composting outright, she said, but they could help grassroots groups become more financially stable even when budgets fluctuate.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/11/new-york-city-community-composting-groups-budget-cuts_4","publication_date":"2024-02-11T17:00:18Z"}}

The critically endangered Tasmanian red handfish population has fallen to between 50 and 100 in the wild, due to the degradation of the seaweed habitat it needs to breed. The fish, which uses its over-sized fins for hands to walk across the sea floor, rather than swim, will now be housed at breeding facilities in Tasmania to protect them from the summer\u2019s expected marine heatwaves. Environment minister Tanya Plibersek said she had provided an exemption under federal environment law for scientists to collect up to 25 red handfish. They will be housed at the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS), which will be monitoring the remaining wild red handfish population for signs of stress, and if necessary, will collect the remaining fish and relocate them to the Institute\u2019s facilities.

{"text":"A list of the 20 costliest climate disasters of 2023 has revealed a \u201cglobal postcode lottery stacked against the poor\u201d, according to an analysis. The research by the charity Christian Aid found that devastating wildfires and floods are hitting those who can least afford to rebuild, and the countries that have contributed least to the climate crisis by burning far fewer fossil fuels than wealthy nations, which have faced fewer climate disasters. The cost ranges from more than $4,000 (\u00a33,155) per person due to a wildfire in Hawaiito $9 (\u00a37) per person due to flooding in Peru. The research examined 20 natural disasters exacerbated by climate breakdown that hit 14 countries over the past year. The highest per capita cost was the wildfires in Hawaii in August, which far outstrips the second costliest, which was Guam\u2019s storms in May, at a cost of nearly $1,500 (\u00a31,182) per person. The analysis published on Wednesday highlights that countries with worse infrastructure and flimsier homes face larger costs after a climate disaster as their inhabited areas are more easily destroyed. In the areas where people have faced the highest costs, many are employed in agriculture, which is vulnerable to extreme weather, and the government is less likely to invest in prevention or rebuilding. Patrick Watt, the chief executive of Christian Aid, said: \u201cWhen it comes to the climate crisis, there is a global postcode lottery that is stacked against the poor. In poorer countries, people are often less prepared for climate-related disasters and have fewer resources with which to bounce back.

Speaking at the National Farmers\u2019 Union in Birmingham, where he will be questioned by the outgoing president, Minette Batters, Sunak will also announce grants for farmers in England \u2013 claimed as the largest ever grant offer \u2013 expected to total \u00a3427m, and which will include an \u201cunprecedented\u201d package of funding for technology and productivity schemes. This comes after the Guardian uncovered that the government had underspent hundreds of millions in its farming budget because land managers had not signed up to the post-Brexit farming schemes, which replaced the EU\u2019s common agricultural policy and are aimed at encouraging farmers to look after nature. The Food Security Index will be published at the next Farm to Fork summit this spring. The UK-wide index will capture and present the key data needed to monitor how the country is maintaining its current levels of food security. Batters has been highly critical of the post-Brexit farming policies, and has accused the government of breaking its promises. Ahead of the conference, she said: \u201cThe promise was three things. The easiest trade deal in history with the EU \u2013 well, that\u2019s still problematic and still being resolved.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/19/english-farmers-to-be-offered-largest-ever-grant-scheme-amid-food-security-concerns_0","publication_date":"2024-02-19T22:30:29Z"}}
{"text":"Fruits that thrive in hot weather and can now be grown in the ever-hotter UK summers, and weeds such as cow parsley to decorate borders, are among the 2024 garden trends predicted by the Royal Horticultural Society. Climate breakdown has influenced most of the trends predicted by the horticulture charity, which seeks insights from its more than 600,000 members to forecast which plants may be in fashion in the coming year. While its trends list used to be based on simply which blooms were in vogue, now it highlights the quirks of gardening in a changing climate amid collapsing biodiversity. The predictions are based on horticultural trends and gardener inquiries to the RHS team of gardening advisers and pathology, entomology and botany experts. This year brought the highest number of inquiries the RHS has ever received \u2013 115,000 questions. Recent hot, dry summers have influenced gardeners to try fruits that would ordinarily have failed in the mild UK weather. The RHS said recent years had been \u201cideal for certain fruits, grape vines being an outstanding example \u2013 but others include figs, almonds, apricots, melons, peaches/nectarines and watermelons\u201d. They said, however, that one of the effects of climate breakdown was unpredictable and extreme weather, including harsher downpours of rain, and that the more usual UK-grown fruits including blackcurrants, apples and pears were struggling as they need sustained cold weather in winter to thrive. Garden designers at the RHS have also noted \u201cthe recent surge in patio fruit varieties, with dwarf raspberries, blackberries and mulberries\u201d. Fruit and vegetable shortages last year caused by severe drought on the continent have inspired gardeners to grow their own.","meta":{"id":"environment/2023/dec/23/survivalist-gardens-and-hot-weather-fruits-among-2024-trends-rhs-predicts_0","publication_date":"2023-12-23T06:00:18Z"}}

In 2018, Broberg, along with a retired hydrologist named Paul Wotzka, started the Minnesota Well Owners Organization to educate and provide support to private well owners in south-east Minnesota. The group regularly runs free water testing clinics, so that well owners can bring a sample from their tap to have it tested for nitrate and bacteria contamination. As people await their results, the mood is anything but light. Residents quietly chat with one another, fretting over the possibility that their water is unsafe to drink. Some come to get their water tested because they have grandchildren in the house, others because they have health issues and wonder if they are linked to the water they are drinking. Broberg says that to fix the problem, it needs to be framed not as a matter of conservation, but as an urgent public health issue. But in a part of the country that\u2019s fiercely proud of its agricultural roots, it\u2019s not always easy.

At least 80 pairs of cranes were recorded in 2023, up from the previous high of 72 two years earlier. The birds, which make distinctive bugling calls but are surprisingly elusive in the breeding season, as they hide in reedbeds, successfully fledged at least 36 chicks. The species, which performs elaborate mating dances each spring, first returned from Scandinavia to breed in east Norfolk in 1979. The population was kept secret for years and very slowly spread. More recently it has been boosted by a reintroduction project where hand-reared cranes were released on expanded wetlands in the Somerset Levels.

The 2030 goal would require big investments in clean energy infrastructure. Under the plans, wind and solar would make up about 70% of the electricity mix in 2030, while 30% of the UK\u2019s electricity would come from a mixture of other low-carbon sources including new nuclear reactors, other renewables and hydrogen.

The study, led by the Indiana University school of medicine, showed that 70% of pregnant women tested in Indiana between 2020 and 2022 had a herbicide called dicamba in their urine, up from 28% from a similar analysis for the period 2010-12. The earlier study included women in Indiana, Illinois and Ohio. Notably, the study also found that along with a larger percentage of women showing the presence of dicamba in their bodies, the concentrations of the weed-killing chemical increased more than fourfold. Both studies found that 100% of the women tested had 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, better known as 2,4-D, in their urine; the more recent study showed detectable, but not significant, increases in concentration levels. The findings add to a growing body of literature documenting human exposure to chemicals used in agriculture, and various known and potential health impacts.

{"text":"A report has called on ministers to scrap the huge subsidies and tax breaks given to conifer forests because they do too little to combat the climate crisis. The report from the Royal Society of Edinburgh said the tens of millions of pounds in subsidies given to the timber industry should instead be spent on longer-living native forests, which have greater and clearer climate and biodiversity benefits. It said the Scottish and UK governments are wrong to argue that public subsidies are needed to help plant more, larger conifer forests. These plantations are largely monocultures using a single species that have a relatively short lifespan. Instead, public subsidies should be diverted to planting millions of native broadleaf trees, including in urban areas, which capture and keep more CO2, support more plant and animal species, store more carbon in the soil, and have a far longer lifespan. The RSE report found that: In Scotland, ministers have subsidised forestry by more than \u00a3390m over the last decade, with roughly 80% of that spent on commercial conifer plantations, as well as extra subsidies for haulage. Timber companies and landowners pay no corporation tax on their income from forests; profits from timber sales are tax-free; there is no capital gains tax on the value of the trees, and 100% inheritance tax relief on the forestry property. Forest owners were also able to sell carbon credits, adding to the attractiveness of forestry as an investment. These grants, tax breaks and carbon credits had helped to substantially drive up land prices in Scotland, up by 73% in a single year, greatly distorting the land market and pricing people out. Government agencies are not properly enforcing policies which require environmental impact assessments on new forest projects; their approach is \u201cinadequate\u201d and \u201cpassive\u201d.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/29/conifer-forest-subsidies-tax-breaks-should-be-scrapped-report_0","publication_date":"2024-02-29T09:00:12Z"}}

{"text":"Global efforts to slow a runaway climate catastrophe may have reached a critical milestone in the last year with the peak of global carbon emissions from energy use, according to experts. A growing number of climate analysts believe that 2023 may be recorded as the year in which annual emissions reached a pinnacle before the global fossil fuel economy begins a terminal decline. The milestone is considered a crucial tipping point in the race to drive emissions to net zero. But for many climate experts it\u2019s an inflexion point that was due years ago and which, although encouraging, falls far short of the rapid reduction the world needs. The world\u2019s leading climate scientists have consistently warned that the buildup of carbon dioxide in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere means it is critical to drive down emissions before 2030 if leaders hope to keep global heating to a maximum of 1.5C above pre-industrialised levels. The rate at which emissions would need to be reduced will require, most experts agree, global transformation on a scale not yet in the pipeline. \u201cWe can take a small pause to celebrate this tipping point,\u201d said Dave Jones, a director at the climate thinktank Ember. \u201cBut in a way it\u2019s worrying that we are still talking about when emissions might peak.

The fishers found that 83% of rivers monitored failed phosphate standards for good ecological status in at least one test, and 44% of site averages for phosphate failed the standard for good ecological status. Aquatic life would struggle to survive in such conditions: phosphates cause an excessive growth of algae, which can decrease the level of oxygen dissolved in river water, choking the creatures within.

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) set aside more than $3bn to give to farmers who practice \u201cclimate-smart\u201d agriculture, but roughly $1.9bn of it is being spent on practices that experts say aren\u2019t actually combating the climate crisis. The report, released today, delves into one of USDA\u2019s largest conservation programs, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Designed to incentivize eco-friendly farming, the program pays for an array of conservation practices proven to reduce emissions or sequester carbon. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is pouring an additional $8.45bn into \u201cclimate-smart\u201d EQIP practices between 2023 and 2026. \u201cA lot of that money will end up going to practices that don\u2019t actually have proven climate benefits,\u201d said Anne Schechinger, an agricultural economist who authored the EWG report. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot outside of these federal programs that are going to help farmers reduce their emissions.

These large-mandibled insects are usually everywhere, slicing and carrying vegetation in columns to create fungal gardens in their nests, which spread out over dozens of metres in Gaudi-esque towers and mounds. Entomologists say these ants have the second most-complex societies on Earth, after humans, and they are the dominant herbivores in the South American tropics, trimming about a sixth of all the leaves produced in the forest. This stimulates new plant growth and enriches the soil. Not for nothing have these ants been described as ecosystem engineers. Each day, I pass three big nests of leafcutters on my daily walk with the dogs. Just over a year ago, I ventured too close during the annual revoada, when the winged females set out on their nuptial flights followed by clouds of males. It is a sensitive time for the insects and the soldier ants were in fiercely protective mode. I was driven away with my foot bloodied and me howling with pain.

A significant part of the Greenland ice sheet itself is also thought by scientists to be close to a tipping point of irreversible melting, with ice equivalent to 1-2 metres of sea level rise probably already expected. The study, published in the journal Nature, used artificial intelligence techniques to map more than 235,000 glacier end positions over the 38-year period, at a resolution of 120 metres. This showed the Greenland ice sheet had lost an area of about 5,000 sq km of ice at its margins since 1985, equivalent to a trillion tonnes of ice. The most recent update from a project that collates all the other measurements of Greenland\u2019s ice found that 221bn tonnes of ice had been lost every year since 2003. The new study adds another 43bn tonnes a year, making the total loss about 30m tonnes an hour on average. The scientists said: \u201cThere is some concern that any small source of freshwater may serve as a \u2018tipping point\u2019 that could trigger a full-scale collapse of the Amoc, disrupting global weather patterns, ecosystems and global food security. Yet freshwater from the glacier retreat of Greenland is not included in oceanographic models at present.\u201d The influx of less dense freshwater into the sea slows the usual process of heavier salty water sinking in the polar region and driving the Amoc.

{"text":"The circulation of the Atlantic Ocean is heading towards a tipping point that is \u201cbad news for the climate system and humanity\u201d, a study has found. The scientists behind the research said they were shocked at the forecast speed of collapse once the point is reached, although they said it was not yet possible to predict how soon that would happen. Using computer models and past data, the researchers developed an early warning indicator for the breakdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (Amoc), a vast system of ocean currents that is a key component in global climate regulation. They found Amoc is already on track towards an abrupt shift, which has not happened for more than 10,000 years and would have dire implications for large parts of the world. Amoc, which encompasses part of the Gulf Stream and other powerful currents, is a marine conveyer belt that carries heat, carbon and nutrients from the tropics towards the Arctic Circle, where it cools and sinks into the deep ocean. This churning helps to distribute energy around the Earth and modulates the impact of human-caused global heating. But the system is being eroded by the faster-than-expected melt-off of Greenland\u2019s glaciers and Arctic ice sheets, which pours freshwater into the sea and obstructs the sinking of saltier, warmer water from the south. Amoc has declined 15% since 1950 and is in its weakest state in more than a millennium, according to previous research that prompted speculation about an approaching collapse. Until now there has been no consensus about how severe this will be. One study last year, based on changes in sea surface temperatures, suggested the tipping point could happen between 2025 and 2095.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/09/atlantic-ocean-circulation-nearing-devastating-tipping-point-study-finds_0","publication_date":"2024-02-09T19:00:21Z"}}

{"text":"For instance, for H\u014dk\u016ble\u02bba\u2019s ocean voyages to Tahiti, the canoe\u2019s navigator must memorise the relative positions of about 200 different stars and watch where they rise and set to ensure the boat arrives safely at a small island in a vast sea. But when it is cloudy at night, wayfinders must find their position and direction of travel using other clues, such as the direction of the waves or the flight path of certain birds. While Polynesians travelled further than most early explorers, they are not the only example of cultures that used impressive methods to navigate. For instance, the Inuit of Greenland carved driftwood in the shape of coastlines to create tactile maps for their journeys over Arctic ice. In Siberia, the Evenki use rivers as landmarks when hunting reindeer. The Pitjantjatjara in Australia use the smell of plants and seasonal changes to identify their routes. The revival of wayfinding in Hawaii is \u201cdelightful\u201d, says Hugo Spiers, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London, who has researched traditional methods of navigation.

But as workers and system managers scrambled to get power back online, some commentators and Coalition MPs were unable to resist the urge to somehow blame renewable energy. In the Australian, the chief executive of the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Paul Guerra, said the outage \u201cmerely highlights how fragile our system is\u201d, saying that \u201csupport for net zero will start to weaken if we get events like this regularly\u201d.

But the activists behind the ballot initiative say it\u2019s part of a broader strategy to ban this type of industrial style of livestock production in which cattle, chickens and pigs are held in confined spaces before slaughter. If successful in Berkeley, a liberal San Francisco Bay Area town that\u2019s often been at the forefront of US environmental policy, the method can be replicated elsewhere, they say. \u201cWe can pave the path to abolishing factory farming,\u201d said Cassie King, an organizer with Direct Action Everywhere, one of the groups that pushed for the measure.

We came across a pool where we found a large slab of rock and flipped it over. Underneath I saw a miniature crab. The first time I tried to pick him up I grabbed a rock, but on the second try I managed to pick him up.

Before his entry into politics in the autocratic country in western Asia, once a Soviet republic, Babayev spent 26 years working for the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (Socar). Close observers of the Cop process will see parallels with the appointment of Sultan Al Jaber, who moonlighted from his role as the chief executive of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company to preside over the summit when it took place in Dubai last year. Sceptics have already begun to point to Babayev\u2019s appointment as raising questions over the commitment to the global phase-out of fossil fuels in Azerbaijan. The country relied on oil and gas for more than 92.5% of its export revenue last year, according to the US government\u2019s International Trade Administration. But Babayev does have form in environmental protection, having spent three years as Socar\u2019s vice-president for ecology, in which time he oversaw efforts to remediate Azerbaijan\u2019s contaminated soils. The country is wrestling with a number of severe ecological problems, including, after 160 years of oil production, decades-worth of damage from the petrochemical organisations that operate there. Born in Baku while Azerbaijan was still part of the USSR, Babayev served in the Soviet military before studying political science at Moscow State University and then foreign economic relations at the Azerbaijan State University of Economics.

The oceans absorb 90% of the heat trapped by the carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, making it the clearest indicator of global heating. Record levels of heat were taken up by the oceans in 2023, scientists said, and the data showed that for the past decade the oceans have been hotter every year than the year before. The heat also led to record levels of stratification in the oceans, where warm water ponding on the surface reduces the mixing with deeper waters. This cuts the amount of oxygen in the oceans, threatening marine life, and also reduces the amount of carbon dioxide and heat the seas can take up in the future. Reliable ocean temperature measurements stretch back to 1940 but it is likely the oceans are now at their hottest for 1,000 years and heating faster than at any time in the past 2,000 years. The most common measure of the climate crisis \u2013 global average air temperature \u2013 was also driven up in 2023, by a huge margin.

Coral reefs are considered one of the ecosystems most at risk from global heating, driven by burning fossil fuels and deforestation, and are home to a quarter of all marine species. Excessive heat can cause corals to separate from the tiny algae that give them their colour and much of their nutrients. Bleaching can kill corals, but scientists say even those that survive are more susceptible to disease and struggle to reproduce. Coral Reef Watch, hosted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, previously issued warnings for coral reefs in four stages, with the highest, alert level 2, suggesting that \u201csevere bleaching and significant mortality [is] likely\u201d. Now the program has added three further alert levels to a program used by scientists, conservationists, marine park managers and citizen scientists around the world to understand the conditions being faced by coral reefs in their areas.

Nevertheless, in the final quarter of last year BYD outsold Tesla in battery-only cars \u2013 526,000 to 484,000 \u2013 for the first time. Most of BYD\u2019s vehicles sell at a lower price point than Tesla, which derives about 20% of its sales from the Chinese market. Chinese electric carmakers such as BYD and Nio have set their sights on becoming major players in international markets, with a particular focus on Europe. In December, BYD, which sells five models in Europe and has plans to launch three more this year, announced plans to build a new factory in Hungary. Last year, the company said it did not consider building its first European factory in the UK because of the impact of Brexit.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/02/chinas-byd-overtakes-tesla-as-top-selling-electric-car-seller_0","publication_date":"2024-01-02T16:17:05Z"}}

{"text":"Biologists say they are now under grim evolutionary pressures that are triggering precipitous declines in their numbers, particularly on the eastern seaboard of America. Hundreds of thousands are having their blood taken, triggering swathes of deaths and reducing populations in key breeding areas such as Delaware Bay in New Jersey. This decrease has also had wider ecological consequences. Major drops in populations of birds, such as the rufa red knot, are now being reported in the wake of the horseshoe\u2019s decline. Every spring, thousands of red knots used to fly to Delaware Bay from the tip of South America and gorge themselves on the millions of eggs laid there by crabs during the horseshoe spawning seasons. Then the birds would fly off for the remainder of their 9,000-mile migration to the Arctic. However, recent drastic drops in red knot numbers have been reported, and these have, in turn, been blamed on the decline of the horseshoe crab. In addition, horseshoes provide fishermen with a key source of bait, and this widespread exploitation has also contributed to the ecological pressures on the horseshoe. As a result, a ban was imposed this year on the harvesting of female horseshoes in Delaware Bay. But many ecologists believe that there is no longer an excuse for using horseshoes, either for bait or as a source of medical materials.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/02/killed-in-vast-numbers-horseshoe-crabs-under-threat-from-overharvesting_1","publication_date":"2024-03-02T10:51:06Z"}}

This H5N1 outbreak is thought to have killed millions of wild birds globally since 2021, and has spread to every continent except Oceania. Avian flu reached the wider Antarctic region in October last year when it was reported on sub-Antarctic islands. The virus was first detected on the British overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, about 1,000 miles (1,600km) away from the continent of Antarctica. It was also found in the Falkland Islands, which is 600 miles north-west of South Georgia.

{"text":"It has been another catastrophic climate year: record-breaking wildfires across Canada scorched an area the size North Dakota, unprecedented rainfall in Libya left thousands dead and displaced, while heat deaths surged in Arizona and severe drought in the Amazon is threatening Indigenous communities and ecosystems. The science is clear: we must phase out fossil fuels \u2013 fast. But time is running out, and as the climate crisis, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation worsen, there is mounting recognition that our political and industry leaders are failing us. If the science isn\u2019t enough, what role could \u2013 or should \u2013 faith leaders play in tackling the climate crisis? After all, it is also a spiritual and moral crisis that threatens God\u2019s creation, according to many religious teachings. Globally, 6 billion people \u2013 about 80% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 identify with a faith or religion, while half of all schools and 40% of health facilities in some countries are owned or operated by faith groups. In addition, faith-related institutions own almost 8% of the total habitable land surface \u2013 and constitute the world\u2019s third largest group of financial investors. How faith and religious communities resist or respond to the climate crisis is crucial, which means faith leaders and leaders with faith have great potential to educate and mobilize their members towards \u2013 or away from \u2013 sustainable living and environmental activism, according to Mitota Omolere, a sustainability expert and author at Earth.org. A 2022 poll found that most American adults, including a large majority of Christians and people who identify with other religions \u2013 consider the Earth sacred and believe God gave humans a duty to care for it. But the poll also found that the most religious are the least concerned about the climate crisis \u2013 in large part because they\u2019re more likely to align with the Republican party, which has a long history of climate denialism and climate action obstruction.","meta":{"id":"environment/2023/dec/23/the-faith-leaders-fighting-for-the-climate-we-have-a-moral-obligation_0","publication_date":"2023-12-23T16:00:29Z"}}

Researchers have previously raised alarm about \u201cone of the largest ecological disasters of modern times\u201d if bird flu reached remote Antarctic penguin populations. The birds are currently clustering together for breeding season, meaning the disease could rip through entire colonies if it continues to spread through the region. King penguins are the world\u2019s second-largest penguin, at about 3ft tall, and can live for more than 20 years in the wild. The suspected case was recorded on South Georgia island in the sub-Antarctic region, according to the latest update from the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (Scar). A gentoo penguin was also suspected to have died from H5N1 at the same location. \u201cOne fatal outbreak in a gentoo colony has been recorded, with the virus confirmed in at least two dead birds\u201d.

Satellite images reviewed by TropWater in late December showed the discharge from rivers from torrential rains delivered by Cyclone Jasper had extended beyond the reefs closer to shore. Dr Stephen Lewis, a water quality expert also at TropWater, said Cyclone Jasper had hit at the end of the sugar cane crushing season when paddocks had been freshly applied with fertilisers and pesticides. He said the timing increased the chances of those nutrients flowing into the reef, but said there was little farmers would have been able to do to prevent it.

Twenty years ago, on 5 February 2004, 23 Chinese migrants drowned in the bay, off Hest Bank, after the water engulfed them as they picked cockles in the dark during a high spring tide. Aged between 18 and 45, the victims, some of whom had only been in the UK a few months and did not speak English, had been lured to the UK from poor provinces in China and exploited by gangmasters, later jailed after being convicted of manslaughter. The tragedy shocked the nation and exposed the dark side of a \u201cwild west\u201d cockle industry in Britain. Tough regulations followed, including the establishment of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, to prevent labour exploitation, which later became the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority.

About 50 million people live with dementia, and the figure is expected to rise to about 150 million by 2050. It is too easy to dismiss this as a natural consequence of an ageing population. A study has looked at the health of more than 413,000 people taking part in the UK Biobank project. All were between 40 and 69 years old and free of dementia, cancer or stroke at the start of the study. Their health was tracked, focusing on the association between air pollution and the transition from being healthy to having a stroke, dementia or both. Data was also collected on their lifestyles, including smoking, exercise, alcohol consumption and diet, as well as their socioeconomic status. Over the course of 11 years, 6,484 people had a stroke, 3,813 developed dementia and 376 had a stroke and developed dementia. Having allowed for other risk factors, the researchers found relationships between long-term air pollution exposure and acquiring dementia, as well as developing dementia after a stroke.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/12/evidence-grows-of-air-pollution-link-with-dementia-and-stroke-risk_0","publication_date":"2024-01-12T06:00:21Z"}}

However, as the Albanese government considers the views of industry players on its proposed fuel efficiency standard, tensions are firming between auto manufacturers and environmental groups about how strict the new rules should be. The standard will place a yearly cap on the emissions output for new cars sold in Australia to incentivise carmakers to supply low- and zero-emissions vehicles and penalise companies that do not. The cap will be lowered over time.

Research carried out in Atlanta, Georgia, found that people with higher exposure to traffic-related fine particulate matter air pollution were more likely to have high amounts of the amyloid plaques in their brains that are associated with Alzheimer\u2019s. The findings, which will alarm anyone living in a town or city, but particularly those living near busy roads, add to the harms already known to be caused by road traffic pollution, ranging from climate change to respiratory diseases. A team of researchers from Atlanta\u2019s Emory University set out to specifically investigate the effects on people\u2019s brains of exposure the type of fine particulate matter known as PM2.5.

Their annual spawning migration can occur any time between January and April, but it\u2019s usually triggered by a spell of mild, damp weather. Emerging from their hibernacula, they begin the journey back to their birthplace, which may be up to 5km and often involves crossing busy roads.

A 2019 study found at least 18,000 radioactive objects scattered across the bottom of the Arctic Ocean, many of them dumped there by the Soviet Union. These objects include vessels such as the K-27, the 110-metre nuclear submarine powered by an experimental liquid-metal-cooled reactor, which was scuttled in 1982 with its reactor still on board (when the explosive charges that were supposed to sink the K-27 failed to fully detonate, it had to be rammed with a tug); the wreck of the K-141 Kursk, which sank in the Barents Sea in 2000 during a naval exercise, killing all 118 on board and bearing its reactor and fuel to the bottom; and the K-159 attack submarine, which sank while being towed near Murmansk in 2003 with 800kg of spent uranium fuel on board. The head of Norway\u2019s Nuclear Safety Authority says it is only a matter of time before these objects begin to release their toxic legacy into the water; others have called the situation a \u201cChornobyl in slow motion on the sea floor\u201d. While the Soviet Union dumped more nuclear waste on the sea floor than any other country, it was certainly not alone.

And while international treaties now prohibit the dumping of radioactive material at sea, the British government is exploring plans to dispose of up to 750,000 cubic metres of nuclear waste, including more than 100 tonnes of plutonium, beneath the sea floor off Cumbria. British officials argue this sort of geological disposal offers a way of keeping waste stable and secure over hundreds of thousands of years, although incidents such as the 2014 leak of radioactive material at a waste disposal facility half a kilometre beneath salt beds in New Mexico suggests that like many of the assurances offered by the nuclear industry, this claim should be approached with great caution.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) \u2013 a group of 10,000 or so human-made chemicals widely used in industrial processes, firefighting foams and consumer products \u2013 are colloquially known as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d due to their persistence in the environment; they do not easily break down. Some PFAS have been linked to cancers, thyroid disease and problems with the immune system and fertility, as well as developmental defects in unborn children. The research by the James Hutton Institute in Aberdeen and the University of Graz in Austria has found that 14 different types of PFAS chemicals, which are commonly used in ski wax, were found in soils at family skiing spots in the Austrian Alps at levels far higher than in areas not normally used for skiing. Lead researcher Viktoria M\u00fcller said: \u201cThese chemicals are called forever chemicals because they will need hundreds of years to break down. Because of this, they could accumulate or spread into the wider environment, including groundwater systems, which is the main concern. \u201cWhile there has been concern about the use of PFAS in ski wax for some time, this study on Alpine ski slopes showed that skiing will produce orders of magnitude higher concentrations of PFAS on to anywhere skiing is taking place where these types of wax area used. \u201cHowever, even where there is no skiing, there are still small detections because of how widely this chemical has now spread in the environment.\u201d Skiers use the wax to make their skis more slippery underneath so they can go down their runs faster. The study, published on Thursday, found that the chemicals in the wax are left behind long after the skier gets to the bottom of the slope.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/25/skiers-leaving-forever-chemicals-on-pistes-study-finds_0","publication_date":"2024-01-25T13:00:03Z"}}

Silicon anodes act like a sponge soaking up water, expanding and contracting with each charge cycle. Adding more silicon increases how much the anode expands and a pure silicon anode can expand up to four times its size. Without intervention, the anode will eventually pulverise itself. One fix involves structuring the silicon in a special way, another is to find additives to change its behaviour. It is possible to solve these problems but making these batteries commercially available for use in EVs remains difficult. As future technologies, manufacturing lines will have to be rebuilt and supply chain issues resolved, particularly as there is no one currently producing enough pure lithium-metal foil to supply car battery manufacturers.

The Italian data protection authority is investigating claims by Belgium\u2019s government that an unnamed police department misused official powers to pass the personal details of Belgian drivers to Euro Parking Collections, which is employed by TfL to issue fines to enforce London\u2019s low emission zone (Lez) and ultra-low emission zone.

TfL denies the claims. It said Euro Parking confirmed it had not used an Italian police department to access driver details. The fines are alleged to have been issued illegally because since Brexit, national laws allow the UK to access the personal data of EU citizens only for criminal offences, and breaching Ulez rules is a civil contravention. Britain\u2019s departure from the EU means there are now questions about how TfL can enforce compliance with London\u2019s clean air rules for foreign vehicles.

The concern is how expensive and elitist they might become.\u201d Small amounts of snowmaking would help to keep some resorts going, he said, particularly those at lower altitude. But snowmaking at scale will never be able to supplant real snow as it is too expensive and uses too much energy and water. According to the most recent study, the use of snowmaking to achieve 50% snow coverage on pistes reduces the number of European resorts at high risk of loss of snow cover to 27% at 2C and 71% at 4C. Although the same study shows emissions from snowmaking are small, at just 2% of overall resort emissions, artificial snow use at scale creates problems in energy and water use.

The protest was the latest in a series of recent actions by farmers across the bloc that have left only four EU member states untouched, as farmers demand higher product prices, looser environmental rules and better protection against cheap imports. Belgium\u2019s main farmers\u2019 union criticised \u201ca lack of concrete results\u201d from talks with the government, saying working groups aimed at finding solutions had turned out to be \u201ctalking shops that come up only with vague, long-term promises\u201d.

There is no safe amount of a microscopic form of airborne pollution known as PM2.5, consisting of tiny particles of soot measuring less than the width of a human hair, for heart and lung health, US researchers found, with even small amounts raising the risk of potentially serious problems. In one of the studies, an analysis of 60 million people in the US aged 65 and older from 2000 to 2016 found there was an increased risk of hospitalization for seven major types of cardiovascular disease when exposed to the average levels of PM2.5 found in the US. The increased level of risk is significant, with the average pollution amount in the US causing the risk of hospital admission to jump by 29%, or nearly a third, compared with the lower air quality guideline level issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). But even the WHO-recommended level isn\u2019t itself safe, the second study found, with a significant increase in hospital visits occurring for cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease, as well as emergency visits for respiratory problems, when short-term PM2.5 exposure was below the WHO limit. \u201cWe are seeing a multitude of effects from this pollution, from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to asthma, and it\u2019s affecting people at very low levels,\u201d said Gregory Wellenius, an environmental scientist at the Boston University School of Public Health and co-author of the second paper. \u201cThis is affecting everyone, not just children and the elderly.

{"text":"A third of UK teenagers believe climate change is \u201cexaggerated\u201d, a report has found, as YouTube videos promoting a new kind of climate denial aimed at young people proliferate on the platform. Previously, most climate deniers pushed the belief that climate breakdown was not happening or, if it was, that humans were not causing it. Now, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) has found that most climate denial videos on YouTube push the idea that climate solutions do not work, climate science and the climate movement are unreliable, or that the effects of global heating are beneficial or harmless. Researchers from the CCDH gathered a dataset of text transcripts from 12,058 climate-related YouTube videos posted by 96 channels over almost six years from 1 January 2018 to 30 September 2023. They also included the results of a nationally representative survey conducted by polling company Survation which found 31% of UK respondents aged 13 to 17 agreed with the statement \u201cClimate change and its effects are being purposefully overexaggerated\u201d. This rose to 37% of teenagers categorised as heavy users of social media, meaning they reported using any one platform for more than four hours a day. The report published on Tuesday shows a shift from the \u201cold denial\u201d \u2013 that climate change is not happening or not anthropogenic \u2013 to the \u201cnew denial\u201d. These new denial narratives that question the science and solutions for climate change constituted 35% of all climate denial on YouTube in 2018, but now represent the large majority (70%). Over the same period, the share of old denial has dropped from 65% to 30% of total claims. The report authors believe that this shift is because the scientific evidence is now more accepted and hard to dispute, so those aiming to win people over to climate denial and delay must discredit the solutions and people pushing for climate action.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/16/third-of-uk-teenagers-believe-climate-change-exaggerated-report-shows_0","publication_date":"2024-01-16T11:00:05Z"}}

Alpino settled here because someone illegally shot the resident male. So when Alpino moved in, he didn\u2019t just mate with GW432f but also with her daughter, producing 15 pups in 2022 rather than a standard single litter. For Kenner, this is a powerful example of why shooting wolves won\u2019t control their population: disrupt a pack, and you may end up with more wolves.

Hitachi owns the site but its future has been uncertain since 2020, when the Japanese company formally abandoned its own effort to build a reactor there after failing to agree financial support with the government. Ministers now hope to strike a deal with Hitachi to acquire the land, with the intention of finding a partner to develop a nuclear power station there. The Wylfa site has been valued at \u00a3200m, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the talks between Hitachi and GB Nuclear. Wylfa is home to the last of the UK\u2019s Magnox nuclear reactors, which closed in 2015, meaning it is deemed a suitable site for a large reactor or a small modular reactor (SMR).

{"text":"The UK should invest \u00a326bn a year in a low-carbon economy to revive prosperity instead of planning tax giveaways that will only lead to further stagnation, leading economists have advised. Investing in energy infrastructure, transport, innovation in new technologies such as AI, and the natural environment would boost the UK\u2019s economy rapidly, the research found. Public investment at that level would be likely to generate about twice as much accompanying investment from the private sector, and would quickly pay off in higher productivity, efficiency savings, economic growth and carbon reductions, according to a major paper by Lord Stern, a former chief economist of the World Bank, and colleagues from the London School of Economics. Current government plans to stifle investment, by contrast, would lead to a \u201ccontinuation of stagnant productivity and weak economic growth\u201d. The findings are strikingly similar to the commitments made repeatedly by Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, to invest \u00a328bn a year in a \u201cgreen prosperity plan\u201d. Those commitments have come under sustained attack from the Tories, and are now to be reviewed by the opposition leadership this week, as some figures within the party are understood to favour dropping the pledge. The authors of the LSE paper, entitled Boosting Growth and Productivity in the UK Through Investments in the Sustainable Economy, published on Monday, arrived at their conclusions independently, by examining the fitness of the UK\u2019s crumbling infrastructure, the challenges and benefits of low-carbon investment, the broader economic environment and international competition. Dimitri Zenghelis, lead author of the paper, said: \u201cThis does indeed mean that Labour\u2019s \u00a328bn-a-year green investment plans are of the right magnitude, consistent with investing in the structural change associated with a sustainable and resilient transition.\u201d But he noted that the investments required \u2013 equivalent to an increase in public investment of roughly 1% of GDP \u2013 were also similar to those espoused by the former prime minister Boris Johnson, when he held the presidency of the G7 group of advanced industrialised nations. Zenghelis said the research suggested that any \u201cfiscal headroom\u201d within the public finances, owing to better than expected economic performance, would be better allocated to investment than to tax cuts, which the Conservative government is planning.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/22/uk-should-invest-in-green-economy-instead-of-tax-giveaways-lstudy-shows_0","publication_date":"2024-01-22T06:00:49Z"}}

The planet was 1.48C hotter in 2023 compared with the period before the mass burning of fossil fuels ignited the climate crisis. The figure is very close to the 1.5C temperature target set by countries in Paris in 2015, although the global temperature would need to be consistently above 1.5C for the target to be considered broken. Scientists at the EU\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service (CCCS) said it was likely the 1.5C mark will be passed for the first time in the next 12 months. The average temperature in 2023 was 0.17C higher than in 2016, the previous record year, marking a very large increase in climate terms.

{"text":"Decaying oil and gas pipelines left to fall apart in the North Sea could release large volumes of poisons such as mercury, radioactive lead and polonium-210, notorious for its part in the poisoning of Russian defector Alexander Litvinenko, scientists are warning. Mercury, an extremely toxic element, occurs naturally in oil and gas. It sticks to the inside of pipelines and builds up over time, being released into the sea when the pipeline corrodes. Some methylmercury, the most toxic form of the metal, is released by the pipelines although other forms can be converted into it. The international Minamata convention on mercury states that high levels in dolphins, whales and seals can lead to \u201creproductive failure, behavioural changes and even death\u201d. Seabirds and large predatory fish such as tuna and swordfish are also particularly vulnerable. Lhiam Paton, a researcher from the Institute for Analytical Chemistry at the University of Graz who has raised the alarm over the mercury pollution, told the Guardian and Watershed Investigations that \u201ceven a small increase in mercury levels in the sea will have a dramatic impact on the animals at the top of the food web\u201d. There are about 27,000km (16,800 miles) of gas pipelines in the North Sea, and scientists predict the amount of the metal in the sea could increase anywhere from 3% up to 160% from existing levels.

The EU imports the equivalent of 80-200 million frogs each year, the majority of which are consumed in France. Most come from wild populations in Indonesia, Turkey and Albania, as well as from farms in Vietnam, according to a study by Robin des Bois and Pro Wildlife, two conservation nonprofits that organised the letter. The practice is \u201cnot at all in line\u201d with the EU\u2019s wildlife strategy, said Sandra Altherr, the head of science at Pro Wildlife. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd: the natural frog populations here in Europe are protected under EU law. But the EU still tolerates the collection of millions of animals in other countries \u2013 even if this threatens the frog populations there.\u201d More frogs\u2019 legs are eaten in France \u2013 often fried in batter or saut\u00e9ed with garlic and parsley \u2013 than in any other country in the EU. The scientists argue that France should push to secure global protections for vulnerable frog species under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites), which works to stop the illegal trade in plants and animals. A group of 46 environment NGOs made a similar request of the French environment ministry in February.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/09/france-appetite-for-frogs-legs-endangers-species-in-asia-say-campaigners_0","publication_date":"2024-03-09T05:00:22Z"}}

Those advertising techniques are evidence that trees bear fruit not for us, but for birds.

Camping had been assumed to be allowed under the Dartmoor Commons Act since 1985, until a judge ruled otherwise last January. It was the only place in England that such an activity was allowed without requiring permission from a landowner. The case hinged on whether wild camping counted as open-air recreation, leading to a long debate in the court of appeal. Lawyers acting for Alexander Darwall, the landowner, argued it was not, because when camping one was only sleeping rather than enjoying a particular activity. After the court of appeal decision, lawyers acting for Darwall, a hedge funder and Dartmoor\u2019s sixth-largest landowner, asked the supreme court to hear the case. Darwall bought the 1,619-hectare (4,000-acre) Blachford estate on southern Dartmoor in 2013. He offers pheasant shoots, deerstalking and holiday rentals on his land.

Purbeck\u2019s mires have enormous significance for rare insects, plants and other wildlife, including bog hoverflies and birds such as skylarks. \u201cUnder the acidic, waterlogged conditions, mosses and other plants never fully decompose, and over time they turn into new peat, which keeps their carbon locked up instead of releasing it into the atmosphere.\u201d The marshes are part of what was designated England\u2019s first \u201csuper national nature reserve\u201d in 2020, a mosaic of heaths, woods, reed beds, salt marsh, dunes and mires. They are among 16 peaty sites in Dorset, covering a total of 425 acres (172 hectares), being improved as part of the \u00a31m Dorset Peat Partnership project.

Over most of the global ocean, the top layer of water (usually a few tens of metres thick) floats on colder, denser water underneath, staying quite separate.

One of the consequences is that animals that live about two-thirds of a mile below the surface and never see the sun\u2019s light, from the petite lanternfish to the giant squid, can still breathe oxygen. Big winter storms at this location add oxygen to the surface water, which sinks downward, then sideways and onward into the rest of the Atlantic, oxygenating the whole middle layer of the ocean.

{"text":"Paton, whose work is published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials, said: \u201cPipelines left on the seabed may be holding onto considerable amounts of mercury which is waiting to be released into the local marine environment if the pipelines are left to corrode away as they are after decommissioning. There is no way to predict the impact of this right now but we do know that the bioaccumulation of mercury within the marine food web is already dramatic and an increase in oceanic mercury concentrations will only come with downsides.\u201d Effects on wildlife and food chains will depend on the form of mercury released from the decaying pipelines, with some forms much less likely to be taken up by marine life than others. According to Dr Darren Koppel, a research scientist from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, it is unlikely that all the mercury released from a corroded pipeline will end up in seawater. The \u201cmercury is more likely to partition between the sediments, water, biota and atmosphere, adding to the global mercury cycle\u201d. \u201cWe still need to understand how clean pipelines need to be of mercury to ensure there will be no long-term impacts to the marine environment. This requires research investigating the long-term fate of mercury if left in contaminated pipelines and the conditions that will result in mercury ending up in food webs,\u201d said Koppel.

{"text":"Hydrogen has long been seen as a wonder fuel that does not give off greenhouse gases when used, and which could help replace fossil fuels. But there is at least one major drawback to this idea because the production of hydrogen largely uses fossil fuels and so making clean hydrogen from the process of splitting water needs renewable sources of electricity. Lots of power is required and it is expensive. Less well known are deposits of natural hydrogen buried underground. Scientists at the University of Lorraine were searching for methane in north-east France, when they unexpectedly discovered a large deposit of natural hydrogen more than 1,000 metres deep underground. This hydrogen is produced by groundwater reacting with iron-rich minerals, splitting the water into hydrogen, possibly renewing itself almost indefinitely. Natural hydrogen deposits have been found before and there is already a small well in western Mali. Larger deposits are thought to exist elsewhere, such as the US, Australia and some European countries. But the discovery in France could be the largest naturally occurring deposit of the gas ever found, possibly 250m tonnes of hydrogen, enough to meet current global demand for more than two years. The challenge is how to transport that gas to where it is needed.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/25/underground-hydrogen-discovery-france-raises-hopes-for-clean-energy_0","publication_date":"2024-01-25T06:00:14Z"}}

Tropical raptor species including the martial eagle, the bateleur and the dark chanting goshawk have vanished from swathes of the African continent over the past 40 years, new analysis shows, as many wild areas were converted to farmland. Several African birds of prey are on track to become locally extinct in many countries this century. Published in the journal, Nature Ecology and Evolution, the new research used road surveys to find that nearly 90% of the 42 raptor species studied had experienced declines, with more than two-thirds showing evidence of being globally threatened. Dr Phil Shaw, the study\u2019s author at the University of St Andrews, said the disappearance of apex raptor species could have unintended consequences for humans, citing the example of the decline in Indian vultures that led to a rise in rabies cases in humans in the early 1990s. The study found that the African birds of prey, many of which are big enough to hunt jackals and antelopes as well as snakes, rodents and smaller birds, were becoming increasingly dependent on protected areas such as national parks and reserves. While many populations of raptors also declined in protected areas, the fall was often significantly slower. The researchers cited the importance of a UN target to protect 30% of the Earth by the end of this decade for nature. \u201cWe find that [while] protected areas do provide a good measure of protection, it\u2019s still the case that raptors are declining within protected areas \u2013 quite steeply in some cases,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cIn fact, we found 40% of those 42 species were declining inside of protected areas at rates that would classify them as being endangered.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/04/birds-of-prey-in-africa-experiencing-population-collapse-study-finds-aoe_0","publication_date":"2024-01-04T10:00:03Z"}}

However, the biggest health impact comes when ammonia reacts with air pollution from traffic and industry to form particle pollution. This creates up to half of the particle pollution in Europe.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/08/ammonia-levels-four-times-higher-in-europes-farming-regions-study-finds_0","publication_date":"2024-03-08T06:00:43Z"}}

Britain\u2019s rejection of rights for nature came during a debate in preliminary negotiations for the UN environment assembly in Nairobi on Wednesday, when government representatives were asked to consider a draft resolution by Bolivia on \u201cliving well in balance and harmony with Mother Earth and Mother Earth centric actions.\u201d This included a passage on the rights of nature. The US, the EU, Canada and the UK spoke against the resolution, saying they had not been given sufficient time to consider a complex issue that Bolivia had submitted at the last moment. The British delegate from the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the draft resolution failed to respect diversity of opinions about how to perceive and interact with nature.

The emissions cap for the budget was 2,544 megatons of CO2 equivalent, but the actual emissions were 391 MtCO2e fewer, or 15% below the budget.

{"text":"Styrofoam (or polystyrene foam) The first disposable cup was actually made from paper. The Dixie Cup, popularized during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, was invented as a more sanitary way for people to drink from shared wells or water fountains. But coffee shops turned to polystyrene foam after it was invented in the 1960s because it helped beverages retain their heat longer. Today, the US produces about 3m tons of polystyrene every year. And 80% of it ends up in the trash (including about 25bn cups each year). That translates to the material taking up about a third of landfill space. As garbage, polystyrene takes about 500 years to break down. Manufacturing a single Styrofoam cup leads to about 33g of CO2 emissions. That\u2019s the equivalent of driving about a 10th of a mile \u2013 which doesn\u2019t seem like much, but when you consider how much polystyrene the US produces each year that adds up to about 21m tons of CO2 \u2013 or about the same amount that 4.5m cars emit each year.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/22/disposable-coffee-cups-environmental-impact_1","publication_date":"2024-01-22T15:00:02Z"}}

A 2010 study on a variety of cleaning cloths used in hospitals reported that microfiber and cotton cloths both cleaned better. That said, your kitchen likely follows different decontamination protocols than the average hospital, and if you\u2019re not regularly washing or microwaving your sponges, a paper towel might not be as bad as the cloth that\u2019s been accruing germs on the edge of your sink all week. It\u2019s worth noting though, said Brian Hilton, a sustainable design technical program manager at the Golisano Institute for Sustainability at the Rochester Institute of Technology, that few paper towels are made from virgin paper. Towels made from recycled paper extend the life of trees cut down to make previously used paper. And, if they\u2019re not soiled, paper towels are compostable (though that doesn\u2019t mean that people remember to put them in their compost bins or that there are composting facilities that can take them in every city). Swedish dishcloths: an increasingly popular way to cut emissions Swedish dishcloths have risen to popularity in part because they feel so much better to use than disposable alternatives. Instead of running through a roll of paper towels to clean up a particularly large spill, you can often get away with using only one Swedish dishcloth (they can soak up to 20 times their own weight in liquid). And instead of tossing each one into the trash can, you can throw your Swedish dishcloth into the washing machine or dishwasher to use again and again (many brands say their dishcloths are equivalent to about 15 rolls of paper towels). The dishcloths wear out eventually, usually after about 6 months, but if you only use one at a time a 10-pack of plainer looking dishcloths that costs about $10 (ones printed by independent designers can cost more) could last five years.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/12/what-is-swedish-dishcloth-reusable-paper-towel-better-environment_2","publication_date":"2024-03-12T12:00:29Z"}}

PFAS are also used to prevent plastics from sticking to equipment during manufacturing, which is what probably accounts for the chemicals found in the baggies, Maffini said. Mamavation\u2019s testing showed levels between 9 parts per million (ppm) and 34ppm, while the FDA allows up to 2,000ppm for seven types of PFAS it allows to be used in food-contact plastic. But it is unclear which PFAS were added to the baggies because the test did not look for individual compounds. The revelation comes just after the EPA found that virtually no level of exposure to some PFAS in drinking water is safe, and a growing body of independent research shows widespread exposure to similar levels in food. Regulators also have a history of allowing subgroups of PFAS to be added to packaging at high levels, only to later determine the products were poisoning consumers. Among the brands Mamavation found contained the chemicals are Boulder, Complete Home, Great Value, If You Care, Lunchskins, Meijer, Target and Walgreens. The only brand that did not show any markers of PFAS was Ziploc.

In contrast, non-native spruce has been found to support just 37 species of invertebrate.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/01/the-trees-are-trying-to-tell-us-things-the-ecologist-championing-our-ancient-forests_3","publication_date":"2024-01-01T16:00:34Z"}}

Guardian Australia heard reports of bleaching at Lizard Island in the north and at Heron Island in the south \u2013 a distance of more than 1,100km (740 miles) along the Queensland coast. The reef has been through six previous mass bleaching events caused by global heating where rising ocean heat has turned corals white across large sections of the reef.

The authority has not declared a mass bleaching event for 2024 and said it would wait for further monitoring and the helicopter survey before deciding if reef-wide surveys were needed. Global heating is the biggest threat to the world\u2019s coral reefs, including the health of the world\u2019s biggest coral reef system.

Now a \u201cpioneering\u201d ground source heat pump has been installed to protect the spectacular Dorset country mansion and its collection of paintings by masters such as Vel\u00e1zquez, Titian and Rubens. The new system should help preserve the art collection by providing a steady, gentle heat without spikes and dips in temperature, as well as saving 30,000 litres of oil each year. It is one of the National Trust\u2019s biggest heat pump projects to date, and the first high-temperature ground source system the charity has installed. The old oil tank has been replaced by almost 6,000 metres (19,685ft) of underground pipes, which transport natural ambient heat in the ground to four high-temperature heat pumps, that in turn warm the 17th-century mansion house and courtyard buildings. The installation of the pipework involved drilling 32 vertical boreholes in an overflow car park, with each hole 180 metres deep. Specialists spent two years conducting extensive archaeological and ecological surveys to ensure the protection of the historic parkland, which includes iron age hillforts, heathland and water meadows. As well as saving approximately 57 tonnes of carbon a year, the new heating system will remove the danger of oil spills from the previous boilers and storage tank. The trust also says the heat pump will improve conservation of the building and its collection by stabilising the temperature and humidity levels. Known as the \u201cpalace of art\u201d, the house has an extravagant Spanish Room that the estate\u2019s 19th-century creator, William John Bankes, designed from exile after he was forced out of Britain because of his gay relationship with a soldier, and his collection of ancient Egyptian artefacts, the largest private collection in the UK.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/17/national-trust-pioneering-ground-source-heat-pump-kingston-lacy_0","publication_date":"2024-01-17T06:00:23Z"}}

Thousands of new green companies were founded in 2023 and overall the sector was responsible for the production of \u00a374bn in goods and services and 765,000 jobs, according to the report by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).

{"text":"Sadiq Khan has hailed what he said was remarkable progress in improving London\u2019s air quality under his tenure as mayor, after a study showed roadside pollutant levels falling faster in the city than elsewhere in the UK. The report, produced by the Greater London Authority (GLA) and Transport for London (TfL), said a good proportion of the improvement was the result of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which was extended to all London boroughs last summer. The expansion of the clean air zone, which requires older and more polluting vehicles to pay a \u00a312.50 daily charge, was fiercely opposed by the Tory central government, and even the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, asked Khan to reconsider the move. The Labour mayor is keen to push his environmental credentials before he stands for re-election in May seeking a third term, and amid criticism that his flagship infrastructure project, the Silvertown road tunnel under the Thames, could worsen air quality. The GLA/TfL report will provide valuable ammunition for Khan and Labour in making the case for the expanded Ulez, which his Conservative opponent, Susan Hall, has pledged to reverse if she wins. According to the research, roadside levels of NO2 pollutants fell by 49% between 2016 and 2023, and were lower last year even than in 2020, when there were extended periods of lockdown during the Covid pandemic. The fall came despite London\u2019s population having risen by more than a million people, the report said, and was a greater fall than in England as a whole with 35%, Scotland 39%, Wales 31% and Northern Ireland 27%. The number of air quality monitoring sites in the capital showing NO2 levels beyond the UK\u2019s annual legal limit fell from 56 in 2016 to five in 2023. Overall air pollution concentrations have fallen by 65% in central London since 2016, 53% in inner London and 45% in outer London. Much of the benefit has come from the Ulez, which was launched in central London in 2019 and then expanded in 2021 and last summer, but improvements have also come from initiatives such as more electric and hybrid buses, and the wider shift towards electric or less-polluting private vehicles, a change the Ulez has helped.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/08/sadiq-khan-hails-remarkable-progress-in-improving-london-air-quality_0","publication_date":"2024-03-08T13:24:42Z"}}

{"text":"The UK spends less on low-carbon energy policy than any other major European economy, analysis has shown, despite evidence that such spending could lower household bills and increase economic growth more than the tax cuts the government has planned. Spending on low-carbon measures for the three years from April 2020 to the end of April 2023 was about $33.3bn (\u00a326.2bn) in total for the UK, the lowest out of the top five European economies, according to an analysis by Greenpeace of data from the International Energy Agency. Italy topped the table for western European economies, having spent $111bn in the period. Germany spent $92.7bn, France $64.5bn and Spain about $51.3bn. The data includes spending on electricity networks, energy efficiency, innovation on fuels and technology, low-carbon and efficient transport and low-carbon electricity. In addition to spending on these measures, all the countries spent substantial amounts on holding down energy bills for households, in many cases more than was spent on low-carbon measures. The UK spent about $42bn on energy affordability in the period, through measures such as the energy bills rebate and payments and discounts for the vulnerable. Only about $13.3bn was spent on energy efficiency for homes and industry, $12.8bn on low-carbon transport and less than $6bn on renewable electricity and innovation in the UK. When spending on energy affordability was stripped out, per capita spending was also much lower in the UK, at just under $500 per person across the three years, compared with more than $950 in France, $1,115 in Germany and $1,880 in Italy. On Wednesday, Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor of the exchequer, will deliver the last budget of this parliament, which is likely to centre on tax cuts that economists have said will mainly benefit better-off people.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/05/uk-spends-least-among-major-european-economies-on-low-carbon-energy-policy-study-shows_0","publication_date":"2024-03-05T05:01:00Z"}}

Last month, the Biden administration brought in new protectionist measures for its EV market by blocking full subsidies through his Inflation Reduction Act to EV companies with significant Chinese links. US-manufactured electric vehicles that include Chinese-made battery components would also be blocked from accessing full subsidies. The Wall Street Journal also reported just before Christmas that the US government was looking at raising tariffs on some Chinese goods, including electric vehicles, to bolster the US clean energy sector. This would be on top of the 25% tariffs on vehicles imported from China, which were brought in under Trump\u2019s presidency, and extended under the Biden administration.

Earlier this year the report found that emissions from generating electricity had plateaued over the first half of 2023 and could be poised to fall from next year.

It found a 16% rise in the amount of solar power generated and a 10% jump in global wind power output.

At the same time the rollout of electric vehicles globally is expected to start eroding the demand for road fuels, which makes up about 50% of the oil demand in developed countries. These trends have accelerated since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which triggered a surge in the commodity price for gas and oil in 2022 and incentivised a renewed focus on securing domestic sources of clean energy instead.

The UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said it did not recognise the claims and that even with new licences it expected oil and gas production to decline faster than the average rate needed to align with the 1.5C pathway. \u201cWe are now a net importer of oil and gas and failing to support domestic production will make the UK more dependent on imports, often with higher production emissions, and weaken our energy security,\u201d it added. The Danish climate ministry said Denmark had taken the lead by setting an end date for oil and gas production. It said the government was \u201cworking with our partners to increase international ambitions and cooperation in this area to pave the way to a managed, Paris aligned and just phase out of oil and gas production\u201d. The German climate ministry said domestic oil production was less than 2% of total demand, similar to its gas production, and that authorising exploration and production was the responsibility of its states rather than the federal government. \u201cAnd here, for example, an expansion of extraction is currently prohibited.\u201d The Norwegian energy ministry said oil and gas was still needed to ensure affordable energy to households and businesses and that \u201cas long as that is the case, it matters that production is happening with low CO2-emissions\u201d.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/12/no-big-north-sea-fossil-fuel-nation-plan-stop-drilling-global-heating_2","publication_date":"2024-03-12T09:00:03Z"}}

From humpback whales to Dalmatian pelicans, each year, billions of animals journey with the seasons over oceans, on land and in the skies. But a new report by the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) has found that many migratory species are at risk of disappearing, threatened by human pollution, the spread of invasive species and the climate crisis. The assessment of migratory animals that are under protection from the treaty found that 22% of the 1,189 CMS-listed species are threatened with extinction and nearly half, 44%, are showing population declines, with many under unsustainable pressure from habitat loss and overexploitation. As much as 97% of sharks, rays and sturgeons on the list are facing a high risk of extinction, with populations declining by 90% since the 1970s. Wildlife can travel enormous distances while migrating, culminating in some of nature\u2019s most dramatic journeys, such as a million wildebeest travelling from the Serengeti in Tanzania to the Maasai Mara in Kenya, and Pacific salmon returning upriver to breed across the west coast of the US. Gorillas and nearly half of all turtles covered by the convention are in danger of disappearing, according to the analysis, while those experiencing declines include bar-tailed godwits, which fly more than 8,000 miles nonstop between Alaska and Australia, the straw-coloured fruit bat, which undertakes the largest mammal migration, across Africa, and the critically endangered European eel. The report comes as governments gather for a summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, to discuss how to better protect the world\u2019s migratory species.

Winter floods in the upper reaches of some parts of the Broads could be pumped along new channels and out to sea just a few miles away, he said.

It is proposing that the world body should gather information about ongoing research into solar geoengineering, and set up an advisory panel that could suggest future options for the untested and controversial approach to reduce global heating, which would have implications for food supply, biodiversity, global inequality and security. The Swiss proposal, submitted to the United Nations environment assembly that begins next week in Nairobi, focuses on solar radiation modification (SRM). This is a technique that aims to mimic the effect of a large volcanic eruption by filling the atmosphere with sulphur dioxide particles that reflect part of the sun\u2019s heat and light back into space. Supporters of the proposal argue that research is necessary to ensure multilateral oversight of emerging planet-altering technologies, which might otherwise be developed and tested in isolation by powerful governments or billionaire individuals. Critics, however, argue that such a discussion would threaten the current de-facto ban on geoengineering, and lead down a \u201cslippery slope\u201d towards legitimisation, mainstreaming and eventual deployment.

This development was soon followed by another in October: Toyota and Japanese petroleum company Idemitsu said they were aiming to develop and manufacture a solid-state electrolyte and bring it to market by 2028. Toyota isn\u2019t the only company working in the area. In January, Volkswagen announced successful testing on a solid-state battery developed by QuantumScape achieved more than 1,000 charging cycles and maintained 95% of its capacity. Meanwhile, Chinese companies such as WeLion and Nio EV have partnered to rush out a solid-state battery \u2013 albeit one with less ambitious chemistry \u2013 by 2024 but McNulty says those in western countries will have to wait until the end of the decade. \u201cToyota has pushed back its solid-state delivery timeline a few times over the years, which I think is a testament to how difficult some of the technical challenges that underpin development of a novel technology can be,\u201d he says.

{"text":"The carotid arteries are the main blood vessels that supply blood to the neck, face and brain. The disease causes a build-up of plaque in the arteries, which substantially raises the risk of stroke. The plaques can be removed by a procedure called carotid endarterectomy. Lab tests on the extracted plaques revealed polyethylene in 150 patients and polyvinyl chloride in 31, alongside signs of inflammation. On examination under an electron microscope, the researchers spotted jagged foreign particles in the fatty deposits, most less than a thousandth of a millimetre across. The doctors followed 257 of the patients for an average of 34 months after they had carotid plaques removed. Those who had plastic particles in their plaques were 4.5 times more likely to have a stroke or heart attack, or to die from any cause, than those whose plaques were free from plastic pollution. Marfella said the discovery of plastics in the plaques was \u201csurprising\u201d and that the likely effect on cardiovascular health was \u201cworrisome\u201d. The findings may explain what doctors call \u201cresidual cardiovascular risk\u201d, he said, where 20%-30% of patients who have been treated for common risk factors, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, still go on to have heart attacks and strokes.

{"text":"The average Australian car needs more petrol to travel the same distance as more efficient models common overseas, with climate advocates saying inaction from the government on fuel-efficiency standards is adding hundreds of dollars to the cost of road trips. Analysis from the Climate Council has found that while drivers of battery electric vehicles charging their cars pay only a fifth of the cost of fuelling an internal combustion engine car, there is still a large discrepancy between how much it costs to run petrol-reliant vehicles of varying efficiency. Based on Australian Bureau of Statistics averages for fuel consumption and petrol prices in the week ending on 10 December, the analysis highlights the growing cost of Australian road trips during peak holiday seasons, the council said. Its analysis has found that it costs $196 to buy petrol for an average Australian passenger car for the trip between Brisbane and Sydney, while for a more efficient petrol car model, it would cost $79. For an electric car on the same route, it would cost just $40 to charge. For a road trip between Melbourne and Sydney, an average Australian passenger car would need fuel worth $178, while a more efficient petrol model would only need $72. For an electric vehicle, it would cost just $38 to charge. Driving from Canberra to Melbourne would require $136 to fuel the average car, but just $55 for a more fuel-efficient model and just $23 for an electric car. Meanwhile, the trip from Brisbane to Cairns needs $368 in petrol for the average Australian car, $149 for a more fuel-efficient model and $75 for an electric car. \u201cThe great Aussie road trip is a summer tradition for many families, but these days, hitting the open road comes at a huge cost to the hip pocket,\u201d said Dr Jennifer Rayner, the Climate Council\u2019s head of advocacy.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/11/australians-paying-hundreds-more-for-fuel-due-to-government-inaction-on-efficiency-standards-advocates-say_0","publication_date":"2024-01-10T20:56:45Z"}}

{"text":"The technical challenges of these ventures demanded a more detailed understanding of the ocean floor. But it was not until the Challenger expedition circumnavigated the globe on its pioneering scientific survey of the world\u2019s oceans in the 1870s that the true extent of the deep ocean finally started to emerge. In the north-west Pacific, where the Mariana Trench plunges downwards into the planet\u2019s crust, HMS Challenger recorded depths in excess of 8,000 metres. Perhaps even more startling to the scientists of the day, though, was Challenger\u2019s discovery of tiny shells \u2013 and therefore living things \u2013 more than 7,000 metres down. Across the century and a half since the Challenger expedition, our understanding of life in the depths has offered many surprises. One of the most important of these involves the existence of thriving communities of living things clustered around hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor. These vents form where cracks in the Earth\u2019s crust allow seawater to come into contact with liquid magma. At the surface, water exposed to magma would simply boil away, but deep below the surface, the pressure prevents this. Instead, the water is expelled back into the ocean in a superheated geyser. These jets can exceed 400C, and bear a stream of minerals upwards from the Earth\u2019s mantle.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/12/radioactive-waste-baby-bottles-and-spam-the-deep-ocean-has-become-a-dumping-ground_1","publication_date":"2024-03-12T05:00:58Z"}}

While many offsetting schemes said they were funding \u201cclean\u201d cookstoves, most did not meet World Health Organization standards, according to the assessment by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. Analysis of common rules to produce the offsets found that projects were allowed to overstate how often people used the stoves and the resulting benefits for nearby forests, dramatically inflating the benefit to the climate and biodiversity , researchers said. The findings draw on previous research on the impact of cookstove schemes by development economists, who found they often failed to produce their potential benefits in practice. Despite the problems, the researchers said the rules on producing carbon credits could be reformed to provide a meaningful source of climate finance that companies could trust. They offer a method that clean cookstove projects can use to avoid overstating their impact, which some of the cookstove companies have already adopted while the paper has been in peer-review. The lead author, Annelise Gill-Wiehl, a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley, said: \u201cComprehensively assessing the five major cookstove offset methodologies, we find that our sample of 40% of the market is 9.2 times over-credited.

The heat-proofing of homes should build on existing initiatives on insulation and energy efficiency to create a national retrofit programme delivered by local authorities and supported by long term funding, the MPs recommended. The government introduced new regulations in 2021 to prevent the overheating of new residential buildings, but these do not apply to the existing buildings that 80% of people will still live in 2050, or offices converted into flats. The MPs also said proposals to encourage access to low-cost retrofit finance for householders were urgently needed.

Though he loves the work, being a small-scale plant breeder doesn\u2019t come without challenges.

{"text":"And while its repositories contain a record of the spasm of environmental destruction over the past century or so, they also stretch back far beyond human timeframes. A surprising amount of our understanding of the Earth\u2019s past climate is drawn from studies of the shells of ancient foraminifera, tiny, single-celled organisms often less than a millimetre in diameter that thrive in the mud on the sea floor or drift with other plankton near the surface. As they die, foraminifera are layered into the sediment that slowly accumulates on the sea floor, so that by drilling down scientists are able to use the different isotopes contained in their shells to reconstruct not just ocean conditions, but changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide, ocean circulation and the extent and rate of change of the ice caps and plant life over the past 100m years or more. * * * It is barely 250 years since western science first began to comprehend the true age of the Earth. This growing awareness of time\u2019s immensity transformed European assumptions about humanity\u2019s centrality to the story of the planet so profoundly that the historian Tom Griffiths has compared the significance of the discovery of deep time to the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions. A fuller appreciation of the scale and significance of the deep ocean requires a similar shift in our understanding of life on our planet. While, as creatures of the light and air, it is easy to assume our planet is defined by terrestrial environments, in fact the opposite is true. The deep ocean is the largest environment on Earth, making up 95% of the ocean biosphere and, depending on how you measure it, close to 90% of the livable space on the planet. Along with the growing evidence of the scale of human impacts on the deep ocean, this makes it clear it is no longer possible to treat the deep as somehow separate from human activity. Nor is it possible to regard it as simply a new frontier to be exploited, as deep-sea mining projects envisage.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/12/radioactive-waste-baby-bottles-and-spam-the-deep-ocean-has-become-a-dumping-ground_10","publication_date":"2024-03-12T05:00:58Z"}}

At between 200 metres and 1,000 metres below the surface, the twilight zone is home to a variety of organisms and animals, including specially adapted fish such as lantern sharks and kitefin sharks, which have huge eyes and glowing, bioluminescent skin. \u201cPenicillin is an antibiotic that originally came from a fungus called Penicillium so we might find something like that from these ocean fungi,\u201d said Fabio Favoretto, a postdoctoral scholar at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.

{"text":"In an otherwise thoroughly wintry landscape, oakmoss, Evernia prunastri, transforms dark thickets of bushes and trees with its almost white, flamboyant and fluffy appearance. Although favouring oak trees the lichen grows on other woody stems. This particular species has made a sudden and dramatic return to areas of Britain and other parts of Europe from where it had almost completely disappeared. It had died out since the Industrial Revolution because the plant could not cope with the sulphur dioxide emissions caused by coal-fired power stations. Where the coal stations have closed, oakmoss has bounced back. The densest colony of the lichen growing locally was on bushes in a nature reserve close to a wind turbine in Heath and Reach, Bedfordshire. The oakmoss was doing the bushes no harm. It is an epiphytic lichen, meaning it grows on the surface of another plant but derives its nutrients from air, rain, water vapour or debris accumulating around it. It is harvested in France for use as a fragrance and in some places people claim it has medicinal properties for intestinal problems, but best to simply admire its beauty.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/03/oakmoss-lichen-transforming-winter-landscape_0","publication_date":"2024-01-03T06:00:13Z"}}

Reef scientists and conservationists went into the summer worried that an El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern would elevate the risk of mass coral bleaching. But so far the greatest concerns have come from December\u2019s Cyclone Jasper and last week\u2019s Cyclone Kirrily, which have seen river catchments push out vast quantities of freshwater laden with sediments and nutrients. The fears come just days before a 1 February deadline for the federal government to report on commitments to protect the reef to Unesco, to avoid it being placed on a list of world heritage sites in danger. Freshwater can cause corals to bleach and turbid water can starve reefs and seagrass meadows of light and promote the growth of algae, making it harder for corals to grow and multiply. Cyclones also whip up strong waves that can damage reefs and tear up seagrass meadows that are habitats for dugongs and turtles and act as nurseries for fish. Despite cyclones usually helping to cool waters, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) told the Guardian that sea surface temperatures remained at least 1C above average across the reef.

{"text":"The study suggested there may be evidence of how human activity had affected the whales. Sperm whales were widely hunted in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. In the 20th century alone, 700,000 died in hunts carried out by Britain, Norway, the Netherlands, Russia, Japan, Canada and Australia, among other nations. Up until 1971, sperm whale oil was used in the automatic transmissions of most American cars. Population numbers have recovered since the 1982 moratorium on the killing of great whales. But as sperm whales can reach up to 80 years in age, it is possible that individuals may retain traumatic memories of 20th-century hunts, the paper suggested. Whitehead told the Guardian that genetics in populations subjected to \u201cintense modern whaling\u201d showed evidence of reduced fertility and fragmented family units.

{"text":"Rishi Sunak\u2019s plan to encourage investment in a string of new gas plants to power the country into the next decade has raised questions over Britain\u2019s future climate ambitions \u2013 and the government\u2019s energy policy record. The government\u2019s biggest set of electricity market reforms in over a decade has angered green campaigners who claim that successive policy failures have forced the government to pin Britain\u2019s energy security on fossil fuels. Does the UK really need more gas plants? Great Britain\u2019s gas-fired power plants generated almost 40% of the country\u2019s electricity last year, and they are expected to continue to play some role in the energy system well into the 2030s. But by the end of the decade almost half of the UK\u2019s gas plants are due to close, leaving a gap in the country\u2019s energy supplies. Currently, the UK has 28 gigawatts (GW) of gas power capacity powering the grid but by 2030 this is likely to fall to about 14GW, according to Aurora Energy Research. This energy gap risks widening after Britain\u2019s nuclear power output slumped to 42-year lows last year, and its new generation of nuclear reactors is making slow progress. The government plans to extend the life of many existing gas plants but it estimates that it will need to have at least 5GW of new gas power capacity in reserve to provide a limited amount of \u201cback-up\u201d power when renewable energy is in short supply. \u201cThe alternative is to risk blackouts \u2013 that is not a risk any household or business would want us to take,\u201d the government said. To date investors have been wary about financing new fossil fuel projects through the government\u2019s capacity market, a kind of reverse auction that offers 15-year contracts to build new energy projects.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/12/what-does-sunaks-plan-for-new-gas-plants-mean-for-uk-climate-targets_0","publication_date":"2024-03-12T18:02:38Z"}}

{"text":"Trees provide innumerable benefits to the world, from food to shelter to oxygen, but researchers have now found their dramatic rebound in the eastern US has delivered a further, stunning feat \u2013 the curtailing of the soaring temperatures caused by the climate crisis. While the US, like the rest of the world, has heated up since industrial times due to the burning of fossil fuels, scientists have long been puzzled by a so-called \u201cwarming hole\u201d over parts of the US south-east where temperatures have flatlined, or even cooled, despite the unmistakable broader warming trend. A major reason for this anomaly, the new study finds, is the vast reforestation of much of the eastern US following the initial loss of large numbers of trees in the wake of European settlement in America. Such large expanses have been reforested in the past century \u2013 with enough trees sprouting back to cover an area larger than England \u2013 that it has helped stall the affect of global heating. \u201cThe reforestation has been remarkable and we have shown this has translated into the surrounding air temperature,\u201d said Mallory Barnes, an environmental scientist at Indiana University who led the research. \u201cThe \u2018warming hole\u2019 has been a real mystery and while this doesn\u2019t explain all of it, this research shows there is a really important link to the trees coming back.\u201d There was a surge in deforestation from the start of the US\u2019s early colonial history, as woodland was razed for agriculture and housing, but this began to reverse from around the 1920s as more people began to move into cities, leaving marginal land to become populated again with trees. The US government, meanwhile, embarked upon an aggressive tree-planting program, with these factors leading to about 15m hectares of reforested area in the past century in the eastern US. The recovery of the US\u2019s eastern forests has blunted global heating mainly through the trees\u2019 transpiration, in which water is drawn up through the roots to the leaves and then released into the air as vapor, slightly cooling the surrounding area. By poring over data from satellites and weather stations located across the eastern US from 1900 to 2000, Barnes and her colleagues found reforested areas have provided this cooling impact on a grand scale, with most of this effect occurring within 400 meters of the trees.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/17/us-east-trees-warming-hole-study-climate-crisis_0","publication_date":"2024-02-17T10:00:11Z"}}

The campaign group Wild Justice, along with the law firm Leigh Day, have submitted plans for a judicial review over what they term an \u201cunlawful attempt to use guidance to introduce a change that was defeated in the House of Lords last year\u201d. Currently, in sensitive areas such as the Lake District and Norfolk Broads, housebuilders have to prevent extra sewage going into waterways, either by updating infrastructure or by buying biodiversity credits, which improve the local natural area and counteract the extra pollution. The regulations were first enacted by the EU in an attempt to prevent damaging buildups of algae and other plants that can choke off aquatic life. Last year, the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, proposed an amendment to the levelling up and regeneration bill, which would strike the directive from the statute book. This would have allowed developers to ignore the rules. The bill was twice defeated in the House of Lords after Labour made it clear it would oppose the \u201creckless\u201d plans. While the bill finally passed, the amendment did not. Now, the government has been accused of trying to bring it back by stealth by publishing a new notice, which says that planning authorities have to presume that water companies have upgraded sewage infrastructure to improve pollution after 1 April 2030, even if they have not.

{"text":"Fossil fuel companies must pay tens of billions to reduce the emissions of methane from their operations or it will be almost impossible to meet global climate targets, the world\u2019s energy watchdog has warned. The US is now the biggest source of methane emissions from oil and gas extraction, as a result of the massive expansion of its oil and gas sector, while China is the biggest emitter of methane from coal mining. Russia also continues to be a major emitter as its fossil fuel operations are poorly run. Leaks from coalmines and oil and gas wells are the biggest sources of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that has caused about 30% of the temperature increases seen to date, according to data published on Wednesday by the International Energy Agency (IEA). About 170bn cubic metres of methane was emitted from fossil fuel operations around the world last year, which is more than the entire natural gas production of Qatar. Yet many of these leaks could easily be plugged if the best practices developed in some countries \u2013 such as Norway, which has low methane leaks from its oil and gas drilling operations \u2013 were adopted around the world. Currently, the least efficient operations are about 100 times worse than the most efficient, with Turkmenistan and Venezuela the worst offenders. One well blowout in Kazakhstan last year produced large quantities of methane for more than 200 days. The IEA calculated, in a global survey of methane published on Wednesday, that $170bn would be needed to reduce global methane emissions by 75%, of which $100bn was needed in oil and gas and $70bn in the coal industry. That would give the world a much-improved chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, the report found.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/13/fossil-fuel-firms-must-plug-methane-leaks-to-meet-climate-targets-warns-watchdog_0","publication_date":"2024-03-13T06:00:05Z"}}

To unpick the wider ecological impacts Palmer and colleagues first studied a number of plots in Laikipia, Kenya, some where elephants were present, some where they were excluded. The team found that when big-headed ants and elephants were present there was a drop in tree cover and a dramatic increase in visibility. The researchers then built a computer model based on observations in the wild to explore whether big-headed ant presence and increased visibility affected zebra movements, zebra kill sites and the movements of lions. The team found zebra kills were almost three times more likely in low-visibility areas where big-headed ants were absent, than in high-visibility areas were the big-headed ants were present. But the analysis ruled out a link to zebra density, or lion activity, suggesting the drop in kills is likely because the lions are more visible to their prey \u201cBecause lions need cover to successfully stalk and ambush their prey they are more exposed when there are fewer trees to hunker down behind, which seems to make it harder for them to successfully take down the zebra,\u201d said Palmer.

{"text":"The oil industry has fought against government support for clean technologies for more than half a century, the Guardian can reveal, even as vast subsidies have propped up its polluting business model. It lobbied lawmakers to block support for low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, electric cars and heat pumps as far back as the 1960s, analysis shows. Trade associations in the US and Europe stymied green innovations under the guise of supporting a \u201ctechnology neutral\u201d approach to avoiding the damage done by burning their fuels. The same incumbents were happy to lobby for government support when they were getting started, and had continued to benefit from it since, said Dario Kenner, a visiting research fellow at the University of Sussex who trawled through decades of public statements from the American Petroleum Institute (API) and FuelsEurope. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously hypocritical to call for technological neutrality when you are the dominant technology,\u201d he said. Kenner documented dozens of examples of the oil industry pressuring governments to hold back support for renewable energy, restrict funding for the development of clean technologies and weaken environmental rules that favoured their uptake. Lobbyists on both sides of the Atlantic argued that government subsidies for clean technologies distorted free markets. Activists say their position is \u201cdishonest\u201d because the oil industry benefits from tax credits and other financial help from governments, and pays for only a fraction of the damage its fuels do to people and the planet. In 2022, the total subsidies for fossil fuels \u2013 including costs to society \u2013 came to $760bn (\u00a3592bn) in the US and $310bn (\u00a3264bn) in the EU, according to the International Monetary Fund.

Its decline is thought to be related in part to changing temperatures and patterns of rainfall. Only four of the 66 species monitored remained stable over the 28-year period. Simon Foster, NatureScot trends and indicators analyst, said climate was \u201cone of the key drivers of change for Scotland\u2019s breeding birds\u201d. \u201cThis report shows how our weather today will affect bird populations in future years,\u201d Foster said. \u201cWith extreme weather such as flooding and heat becoming more prevalent, we must ensure that improving Scotland\u2019s nature and habitats uses the latest science to help deliver the best results.\u201d Initiatives such as the diversification of woodland, peatland restoration schemes and work by farmers to create new habitats are among those which need to be intensified in coming years in order to reverse and restore these declines, Foster said. Terrestrial breeding birds are understood to be good indicators of overall biodiversity because they respond quickly to changes in habitat. Their overall numbers declined steeply between 2021 and 2022 in Scotland despite warm temperatures, a change which researchers suggest may be linked to the country experiencing its driest summer in 25 years.

After Brexit, the UK started its own smaller version, called UK Reach. Eight rules restricting the use of hazardous chemicals have been adopted by the EU since Brexit, and a further 16 are in the pipeline.

Instead, the EU banned all emergency authorisations of neonicotinoid pesticides while since 2021 the UK government has allowed the emergency use of thiomethoxam every year.

Not only does this bill fail to make Britain energy independent, but it does nothing to support oil and gas workers, and, as has been admitted by the energy secretary, it won\u2019t lower bills either. The construction of new oil and gas projects also threatens our ocean wildlife and undermines the UK\u2019s commitment to protect 30% of the sea for nature by 2030. This bill does achieve two things, however. First, by sowing division it fractures the UK\u2019s valuable political consensus on climate action. And second, it sends an unmistakable message to the global community that Britain is no longer a leader on this critical agenda, but a laggard, doubling down on fossil fuels and holding back the transition to renewables, just at the moment when we should be accelerating.

Prince Harry was president of African Parks for six years, before being elevated to the board of directors from 2023. The movement of elephants was among the largest of its kind ever attempted, the conservation groups said at the time. The groups used images of the 263 elephants being transported for fundraising, and videos of the huge animals being lifted by crane were described as \u201cscenes reminiscent of the Disney classic Dumbo\u201d. In the days after the translocation, however, two people were killed by elephants in the area the animals were moved to, and a third person was killed in September that year. Communities warned of growing problems with human-wildlife conflict with the African mammals, which frequently raid crops.

Other campaigns have started up with similar themes, including Get Fair About Farming, which was set up last year by the founder of organic vegetable-box company Riverford, Guy Singh-Watson, with a petition debated in parliament last month. Andrew Gibson, who helped organise the Dover protest with his brother Jeff, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had support from all round the country. There will be other groups like us and they will make their presence felt \u2013 around the docks, around supermarket distribution centres.\u201d The Kent farmers took inspiration from their counterparts in France who blocked motorways into Paris for more than a week until the government promised extra funds, looser regulation and protection against unfair competition. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting into London, because we\u2019d get shooed out pretty quickly, but I think we\u2019d like to do that,\u201d Gibson said.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/10/uk-farmers-vow-to-mount-more-blockades-over-cheap-post-brexit-imports-and-supermarket-prices_0","publication_date":"2024-02-10T17:01:13Z"}}

MethaneSat is scheduled to launch from California onboard a SpaceX rocket on Monday at 2pm local time (22:00 GMT). It will provide the first near-comprehensive global view of leaks of the potent greenhouse gas from the oil and gas sector, and all of the data will be made public. It will provide high-resolution data over wider areas than existing satellites. Methane, also called natural gas, is responsible for 30% of the global heating driving the climate crisis. Leaks from the fossil fuel industry are a major source of human-caused emissions and stemming these is the fastest single way to curb temperature rises. MethaneSat was developed by the Environmental Defense Fund, a US NGO, in partnership with the New Zealand Space Agency and cost $88m to build and launch. Earlier EDF measurements from planes show methane emissions were 60% higher than calculated estimates published by US authorities and elsewhere. More than 150 countries have signed a global methane pledge to cut their emissions of the gas by 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Some oil and gas companies have made similar pledges, and new regulations to limit methane leaks are being worked on in the US, EU, Japan and South Korea.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/04/satellite-to-name-and-shame-worst-oil-and-gas-methane-polluters_0","publication_date":"2024-03-04T13:54:28Z"}}

The average age of a British farmer is 59; the hold of the older generation is seen as so deadlocked that in 2019, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, began offering lump-sum payments to older farmers to persuade them to hurry up and get out. But retirement is a tricky subject: how exactly do you retire from your own home? According to 2010 research by Matt Lobley at Exeter University, 84% of UK farms are family businesses \u2013 meaning that at least two generations of the same family are involved. Of the 688 farmers Lobley surveyed, 21% expected never to retire and 27% of those aged over 65 had not yet identified any successor. But if the workforce is static, the global economy is not. The result is that much of British farming no longer makes financial sense. The price of food is low but the cost of land is high. So at the smaller end, a traditional farm with land and assets worth, say, \u00a31.8m, may be struggling to sell what it produces \u2013 lamb, wheat, beef \u2013 at break-even point, let alone take a bare-bones income for those who live on it. Which almost certainly means that someone in the family is out there propping up the finances with another job, and may also mean that for the next generation, the prospect of working 24/7 to produce potatoes or apples or sausages or milk for a truculent public and an underpaying supermarket chain doesn\u2019t seem all that alluring.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/09/farming-is-a-dirty-word-now-the-woman-helping-farmers-navigate-a-grim-uncertain-future_2","publication_date":"2024-01-09T05:00:57Z"}}

However, Myllyvirta\u2019s analysis found that China was \u201cway off track\u201d on many of these targets, primarily because of the carbon intensity of recent economic growth. CO2 emissions will have to fall by between 4% and 6% to meet the government\u2019s 2025 target, Myllyvirta predicts.

At the same time, many other countries targeted their stimulus measures towards households, driving up demand for consumer goods, resulting in an export boom from China. It is not impossible to do, said Myllyvirta: \u201cOptimistically, these distortions to the economic structure before and during zero-Covid could be reversed, and that combined with the clean energy drive could serve to bring down emissions rapidly.\u201d Around one percentage point of China\u2019s CO2 emissions growth last year came from manufacturing clean energy technologies, such as solar PV, electric vehicles and batteries.

Forests with two or three tree species are on average 35% more resilient to storms than forests with only one species, simulations created by researchers found. The type of trees also matters \u2013 forestry plantations are typically made up of fast-growing tall trees such as conifers, but they are more vulnerable to high winds than slower-growing hardwood species such as oak. Extreme weather events such as Storm Isha \u2013 which caused deaths, power cuts and flooding across the UK \u2013 are likely to hit more frequently as the climate crisis goes on, because warm air holds more moisture, which in turn fuels storms.

The situation had been complicated, she said, by the fact that the issue straddles the national border, requiring the US and Mexican governments to work together. In January, Mexico broke ground on a new wastewater treatment plant to replace an outdated facility in Punta Bandera, six miles south of the border. Meanwhile, the US government in 2020 approved a $300m fund to expand a wastewater treatment plant in San Ysidro, just north of the border. But a government memo obtained by the San Diego Union Tribune last year revealed the facility had been in such disrepair that half the funds would be needed just to maintain the existing infrastructure. Aguirre and other local officials and advocates have since been pushing for an additional $310m in federal funds to improve wastewater treatment capacity, which Joe Biden included in an October emergency supplemental funding request that has yet to be approved by Congress. California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, and Congressman Scott Peters, whose district borders Imperial Beach, have also urged urgent action. \u201cIn the history of this issue, we have never had as much attention on it as we have had these past 12 months,\u201d said Aguirre.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/15/us-mexico-california-tijuana-river-illness-public-health_1","publication_date":"2024-02-15T19:17:40Z"}}

{"text":"What is sewage fungus? It is slimy, murky brown, smells bad, and fills river enthusiasts and anglers with gloom. But it is probably useful to know that sewage fungus, so called because of its fungal-shaped mass of filaments, is not fungus at all, but is primarily made up of several species of bacteria, most commonly Sphaerotilus natans, Beggiatoa alba, Carchesium polypinum, and Flexibacter species. By the time you see its characteristic slimy, floating fronds, it will contain some fungi and algae, too, and it always spells bad news for the river in which it is spotted and for any unfortunate wildlife living there. Where do you find it and where does it come from? Sewage fungus flourishes in waterways polluted with high levels of nutrients and organic matter. Sewage discharges are a common source of this kind of pollution, but these microorganisms can also be carried into waterways from animal slurry and even from effluent from paper mills. Last month, a Devon farmer was fined \u00a36,000 for polluting a stream with slurry, with thick sewage fungus visible for more than a mile downstream, the Environment Agency reported. A study by Oxford University found that sewage pollution, whether treated or untreated, was the primary reason for increased sewage fungus in rivers.

The report calls for the Conservative government to finally implement rules to create sponge cities after a decade in which ministers have delayed and attempted to scrap the plans. Sponge cities are urban zones with multiple areas of greenery, trees, ponds, soakaways, pocket parks and permeable paving to allow water to drain away. They also include measures to store rainwater and runoff, such as widespread use of water butts. Increased runoff from rainfall overwhelms water company sewage systems, which have not been maintained and improved by water companies as a result of under-investment. The extra water increases the likelihood of raw sewage being discharged, while hard surfaces in towns and cities increase the risk of flooding. In its latest business plan, Thames Water says by 2015 London had seen the biggest decrease in plant cover in front gardens of anywhere in the UK, with five times as many front gardens with no plants compared with the preceding 10 years. This increased the burden on sewers and the risk of pollution, the company said.

They highlighted a competition schedule that forced skiers to take air flights backwards and forwards over the Atlantic from week to week, creating unnecessarily large carbon footprints, and called on the federation to open the season later and end it earlier to respect the changing climate. This was followed in October by a petition calling for the federation to do more to tackle climate change, which has attracted more than 35,000 signatures. The campaign wants the FIS to publish its own environmental impact with full transparency, move the race calendar by at least one month to respect the changing climate, reduce the requirement for air travel, and use its political influence to advocate for climate action at a governmental level. \ufeffThe FIS said that as a signatory to the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework (UNFCCC) it was committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 50% by 2030. \u201cWe are working on a sustainability plan that will see us collecting as much data during the upcoming winter season as possible to provide the most accurate estimate of our CO2 footprint.","meta":{"id":"environment/2023/dec/26/ski-resorts-battle-for-a-future-as-snow-declines-in-climate-crisis_1","publication_date":"2023-12-26T07:25:56Z"}}

{"text":"The internationally agreed threshold to prevent the Earth from spiraling into a new superheated era will be \u201cpassed for all practical purposes\u201d during 2024, the man known as the godfather of climate science has warned. James Hansen, the former Nasa scientist credited for alerting the world to the dangers of climate change in the 1980s, said that global heating caused by the burning of fossil fuels, amplified by the naturally reoccurring El Ni\u00f1o climatic event, will by May push temperatures to as much as 1.7C (3F) above the average experienced before industrialization. This temperature high, measured over the 12-month period to May, will not by itself break the commitment made by the world\u2019s governments to limit global heating to 1.5C (2.7F) above the time before the dominance of coal, oil and gas. Scientists say the 1.5C ceiling cannot be considered breached until a string of several years exceed this limit, with this moment considered most likely to happen at some point in the 2030s. But Hansen said that even after the waning of El Ni\u00f1o, which typically drives up average global heat, the span of subsequent years will, taken together, still average at the 1.5C limit. The heating of the world from greenhouse gas emissions is being reinforced by knock-on impacts, Hansen said, such as the melting of the planet\u2019s ice, which is making the surface darker and therefore absorbing even more sunlight. \u201cWe are now in the process of moving into the 1.5C world,\u201d Hansen told the Guardian. \u201cYou can bet $100 to a donut on this and be sure of getting a free donut, if you can find a sucker willing to take the bet.\u201d In a bulletin issued with two other climate researchers, Hansen states that \u201cthe 1.5C global warming ceiling has been passed for all practical purposes because the large planetary energy imbalance assures that global temperature is heading still higher\u201d. Hansen has promoted a view, disputed by some other climate scientists, that the rate of global heating is accelerating due to a widening gap between the amount of energy being absorbed by the Earth from the sun and the amount returning to space.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/08/global-temperature-over-1-5-c-climate-change_0","publication_date":"2024-01-08T16:07:21Z"}}

Labour accused Rishi Sunak of being \u201casleep at the wheel\u201d over flood warnings at the end of a week in which at least 1,000 properties were flooded and some villages were totally cut off, with parts of Nottinghamshire, Shropshire, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire worst affected. The Environment Agency (EA) in England blamed the floods on the climate crisis as it advised people in flood risk areas to turn off gas, water and electricity supplies, take possessions upstairs, and move family, pets and cars to safety. Though the rain is forecast to subside over the weekend, temperatures are likely to plummet, causing more misery for those trying to clean up their homes and businesses after the deluge. Flood-hit residents were warned to brace themselves for five more days of misery because the ground was \u201ccompletely saturated\u201d, the EA said. Hundreds of flood warnings and alerts remained in place across England and Wales on Friday evening with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issuing a cold weather alert from Saturday. This winter the National Audit Office revealed that the number of properties to receive better protection from flooding by 2027 had been cut by 40%, and 500 of 2,000 new flood defence projects had been abandoned. The prime minister was booed on Friday as he left a cafe in Marple, Stockport, after talking to activists in the marginal Tory-Lib Dem constituency of Hazel Grove. Those heckling him called on him to resign, although not necessarily because of his handling of the floods.

Until now, mink have never been successfully removed from any large area of Britain but the success of a trial using drops from the invasive predator\u2019s pungent anal scent gland to lure animals into hundreds of traps raises hopes that the species can be eradicated from the whole country. After four years of trapping using 441 \u201csmart\u201d traps, monitoring confirmed that there had been no evidence of mink reproduction in 2023 across central and eastern Norfolk and Suffolk, an area of 5,852 sq km, almost 5% of England. This \u201ccore area\u201d was protected with further traps across a 60km-wide \u201cbuffer zone\u201d that prevented mink from entering from the west and south. The mink eradication trial was devised in 2019 by a coalition of conservation charities and water management organisations, a partnership that led to the creation of conservation charity the Waterlife Recovery Trust. Prof Tony Martin, the chair of the WRT and a global expert in eradicating non-native predators for the benefit of native wildlife, said: \u201cUntil now, the complete removal of American mink from Britain has been an impossible dream, but the success of this trial offers hope that a century of catastrophic damage to precious native wildlife can be brought to an end. \u201cIt\u2019s now a race against time to eradicate mink before they wipe out the last of our water voles and drive the final nail into the coffin of seabird colonies already hammered by avian influenza.\u201d Populations of water voles in Britain have declined by 96% since 1950, driven by habitat loss but also the spread of non-native mink, for whom the voles are easy prey. Coastal seabird colonies within swimming range of the amphibious mink have also suffered severe losses of adult birds and chicks to the North American mustelid. Although releases of American mink from fur farms by animal rights activists garnered much publicity in the 1990s, mink had established themselves in the wild in the 1950s, escaping from some of the 400 fur farms in Britain.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/15/smart-trap-trial-raises-hopes-american-mink-can-be-driven-from-uk_0","publication_date":"2024-01-15T06:00:05Z"}}

It is also based on incompetent misunderstandings by government scientists of their own findings and the misbriefing of their minister.\u201d It is believed ministers wish to create a point of difference with the Labour party, which has said it would stop the cull, in an attempt to retain seats in rural areas. Recent polling by the Country Land and Business Association shows the majority of Conservative MPs in the most rural areas are at risk of losing their seats to Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the upcoming general election.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/14/uk-government-overturns-plans-to-phase-out-badger-cull_0","publication_date":"2024-03-14T14:36:09Z"}}

{"text":"British households will benefit from improved routes for recycling electronic goods from 2026, under government plans to have producers and retailers pay for household and in-store collections. Consumers would be able to have electrical waste (e-waste) \u2013 from cables to toasters and power tools \u2013 collected from their homes or drop items off during a weekly shop, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said in a consultation published on Thursday. The ambition is for retailers, rather than the taxpayer, to pick up the tab for these new ways of disposing of defunct, often toxic products safely. The measures are due to come into force in two years\u2019 time. Almost half a billion small electrical items ended up in landfill last year, according to data from the not-for-profit Material Focus. This problem was particularly acute during Christmas, when 500 tonnes of Christmas lights were thrown away, the government said. The latest proposals build on efforts to grapple with the issue that the UK helped develop as a member of the EU. This included the Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive, which came into effect in 2012. As with other waste-related rules they follow a principle that the producer of the waste will foot the bill for its disposal, which the UK and EU have followed in areas such as plastic packaging. The EU this year adopted policy recommendations for member states to improve collection of recycled materials, although targets vary by country.","meta":{"id":"environment/2023/dec/28/retailers-to-pay-for-consumers-e-waste-recycling-from-2026-under-uk-plans_0","publication_date":"2023-12-28T00:01:19Z"}}

{"text":"Labour\u2019s slashing of proposed spending on home insulation will leave millions of people on low incomes in cold, damp homes and could prevent the UK meeting its legally binding carbon targets, campaigners and housebuilders have warned. The Federation of Master Builders criticised the drastic scaling back of Labour\u2019s low-carbon policies, announced by Keir Starmer on Thursday after months of speculation. Brian Berry, chief executive of the body representing the building trade, said: \u201cIt is disappointing that the Labour party has decided to roll back its ambition to retrofit 19m homes to just 5m. Sadly, this is just one of many damaging and disjointed policy efforts over the last decade to deliver green upgrades, which every time ends up hitting the confidence of industry and consumers.\u201d The new plans were \u201csimply not enough\u201d and would \u201cbarely scratch the surface\u201d of the need for insulation, he said, missing the opportunities home insulation offers for saving energy, benefiting householders and the wider economy. \u201cRetrofitting the UK\u2019s 28m homes, the oldest in Europe, would help stimulate economic growth in every community, but time after time the opportunity to do so is lost,\u201d he said. Many major housebuilders have been among the most generous donors to the Tory party in the past decade, but the industry was broadly supportive of Labour\u2019s plans for 1.5m new homes. Energy experts also said Labour\u2019s decision to slash its home insulation programme could mean that, in government, it would be at risk of failing to meet the legally binding targets on carbon reduction and ending fuel poverty by 2030. The 4m homes that will not now be insulated by 2030, under the plans, would account for about 1% of the UK\u2019s emissions in that year, leaving a substantial gap, as the UK has pledged under the Paris agreement to cut emissions by 68% by 2030 and is not on track to meet that goal. Juliet Phillips, UK energy lead at the environmental thinktank E3G, said: \u201cInvesting in warmer homes is essential to solving the fuel poverty crisis. However, under the current government, we\u2019ve seen a massive collapse in the installer workforce needed to deliver these improvements.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/10/labour-reduced-home-insulation-plans-housebuilders-campaigners_0","publication_date":"2024-02-10T06:00:36Z"}}

The decision comes despite warnings from scientists that it could have a devastating impact on marine life, and opposition from the EU and the UK, which have called for a temporary ban on deep-sea mining because of environmental concerns. The proposal, voted in by 80-20 by Norway\u2019s parliament after attracting cross-party support, is expected to speed up exploration of minerals \u2013 including precious metals \u2013 that are in high demand for green technologies. While the decision will initially apply to Norwegian waters, it will expose an area larger than Britain \u2013 280,000 sq km (108,000 sq miles) \u2013 to potential mining by companies, which will be able to apply for licences to mine minerals including lithium, scandium and cobalt. It is anticipated that an agreement on deep-sea mining in international waters could follow later in the year. After the vote, the Norwegian government was immediately criticised for going against environmental scientists and the advice of its own experts. Greenpeace called it was \u201ca shameful day\u201d for Norway. \u201cIt is embarrassing to watch Norway positioning itself as an ocean leader while giving the green light to ocean destruction in Arctic waters,\u201d said Frode Pleym, head of Greenpeace Norway. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t end here.

{"text":"Strong oil demand forecasts can create a self-fulfilling prophecy. They might encourage governments to back further oil and gas exploration to avoid a shortfall, which in turn can lead to lower oil commodity prices if there is more oil and gas than needed. This creates a disincentive to switch from a fossil fuel vehicle or heating system to an electric alternative if it\u2019s cheaper to use gas or oil. Opec has consistently underestimated the rollout of electric vehicles in its official forecasts, which are used by governments to inform their policies, according to experts. Its forecasts for the number of electric vehicles on the roads by 2022 were too low by an average of almost 60% over the period 2015-2021, according to a recent report by Zero Carbon Analytics. In 2021, the cartel\u2019s forecasts for the global electric vehicles fleet just one year ahead were wrong by 49%, the report found. Amy Kong, the author of the report, said the forecasts were \u201cwildly wrong year after year\u201d in what appears to be an \u201cunderhand attempt by oil producers to persuade investors and governments that fossil fuels have a future\u201d.

{"text":"A severe crackdown on environmental protest in Britain with \u201cdraconian\u201d new laws, excessive restrictions on courtroom evidence and the use of civil injunctions is having a chilling impact on fundamental freedoms, the United Nations special rapporteur has said. As the world faces a triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, environmental protesters were acting for the \u201cbenefit of us all\u201d and must be protected, Michel Forst, the UN special rapporteur on environmental defenders, said on Tuesday. Forst said that during a two-day visit to the UK earlier this month he uncovered worrying information on the treatment of peaceful protesters. Rules imposed on defendants in one London court have prevented them from explaining their motivations to the jury. At Inner London crown court, peaceful protesters have been forbidden by court order from mentioning the climate crisis, fuel poverty or even the US civil rights movement in their statements to the jury. \u201cIt is very difficult to understand what could justify denying the jury the opportunity to hear the reason for the defendant\u2019s action, and how a jury could reach a properly informed decision without hearing it, in particular at the time of environmental defenders\u2019 peaceful but ever more urgent calls for the government to take pressing action for the climate,\u201d Forst said. He said the prosecution of peaceful protesters under \u201cregressive\u201d new public nuisance laws in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, which carried a 10-year sentence, and the use of the Public Order Act 2023 was criminalising peaceful demonstrations. Forst highlighted the case of a peaceful protester jailed in December for six months for walking slowly down a road for 30 minutes during a climate protest under the new public order law. \u201cIt is important to highlight that, prior to these legislative developments, it had been almost unheard of since the 1930s for members of the public to be imprisoned for peaceful protest in the UK,\u201d said Forst, in a statement issued on Tuesday morning. \u201cI am therefore seriously concerned by these regressive new laws.\u201d","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/23/un-expert-condemns-uk-crackdown-on-environmental-protest_0","publication_date":"2024-01-23T11:34:06Z"}}

It follows Guardian Australia publishing photos of seriously injured and dead koalas, and the Seven Network airing footage of koalas clinging to and being thrown from falling blue gums.

Scientists working off the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean found that coral larvae were up to seven times more likely to settle at a struggling reef where they played recordings of the snaps, groans, grunts and scratches that form the symphony of a healthy ecosystem. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this may be something we can combine with other efforts to put the good stuff back on the reef,\u201d said Nade\u0300ge Aoki at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. \u201cYou could leave a speaker out for a certain amount of time and it could be attracting not just coral larvae but fish back to the reef.\u201d The world has lost half its coral reefs since the 1950s through the devastating impact of global heating, overfishing, pollution, habitat loss and outbreaks of disease. The hefty declines have fuelled efforts to protect remaining reefs through approaches that range from replanting with nursery-raised corals to developing resilient strains that can withstand warming waters. Aoki and her colleagues took another tack, building on previous research which showed that coral larvae swim towards reef sounds. They set up underwater speakers at three reefs off St John, the smallest of the US Virgin Islands, and measured how many coral larvae, held in sealed containers of filtered sea water, settled on to pieces of rock-like ceramic in the containers up to 30 metres from the speakers. While the researchers installed speakers at all three sites, they only played sounds from a thriving reef at one: the degraded Salt Pond reef, which was bathed in the marine soundscape for three nights. The other two sites, the degraded Cocoloba and the healthier Tektite reefs were included for comparison.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/13/playing-thriving-reef-sounds-underwater-speakers-save-damaged-corals_0","publication_date":"2024-03-13T06:00:07Z"}}

The latest analysis also provides the strongest data so far showing that protected areas that are connected to other places are far better than isolated \u201cfortress\u201d parks at maintaining stable populations, by allowing the elephants to migrate back and forth between areas as they did naturally in the past. When numbers rise in highly protected core areas, corridors into less protected buffer areas allow the animals to disperse. They may also migrate if poaching increases or drought strikes. If numbers later fall in the core areas, or conditions improve, elephants can flow back again. However, many more people live in the buffer areas and the scientists said careful planning was crucial to minimise conflicts with the elephants, which can kill people and destroy crops. In contrast to the connected areas, the scientists found that isolated parks, which keep animals in and people out, can lead to unsustainable population booms, and in turn sometimes mass deaths or culling. \u201cFor decades, news from southern Africa was dominated by waves of poaching and other threats,\u201d said Dr Robert Guldemond at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, and part of the study team. \u201cBut there\u2019s been a lot of good work done that has basically turned the tide and that story has never really been told.\u201d Dr Ryan Huang, also at the University of Pretoria, said: \u201cThis is a good news story for a lot of elephants.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/05/african-elephant-populations-stabilise-in-southern-heartlands_0","publication_date":"2024-01-05T19:32:55Z"}}

Researchers at the Joint European Torus (JET), an experimental fusion reactor at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy in Oxfordshire, generated 69 megajoules of energy over five seconds from a mere 0.2 milligrams of fuel in the final fusion experiment performed at the facility. The burst of energy, equivalent to 16.5kg of TNT, was described as a \u201cfitting swansong\u201d for the project, which has pioneered technology for future commercial fusion reactors since it began operating in 1983. It beat the previous record of 59 megajoules of heat, set by the same facility in 2022. If fusion power is shown to be viable at scale, future reactors could drive a green energy revolution. One kilogram of fusion fuel contains about 10m times more energy than a kilogram of coal, oil or gas, and fusion reactions do not release greenhouse gases. The JET facility ended its scientific work in December. It will now be decommissioned in a 17-year process that researchers will document in painstaking detail to inform the building and dismantling of fusion reactors in the decades ahead. More than 300 scientists and engineers from a consortium called EUROfusion contributed to the experiments.

{"text":"From deadly floods in California to devastating fires in Chile, scientists say the world is not prepared for the climate disasters that are hitting with increasing frequency as human-driven global heating continues to break records. The hottest year in history has been followed by the warmest ever January. Many regions in the northern hemisphere are sweltering in heatwaves that would be more normal in June. Marine scientists are shocked by the prolonged and intense heat at the surface of the oceans. Scientists say the extreme heat is mostly the result of human activity, such as the burning of oil, gas and coal and the cutting down of forests. This has been amplified by natural factors, particularly the El Ni\u00f1o \u2013 a phenomenon associated with Pacific Ocean warming \u2013 that started last year and is expected to continue until spring at the earliest. This year has a one in three chance of being even hotter than last year\u2019s record, according to the US\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The higher the global temperature, the greater the risk of fires and flooding. This month alone has seen two grim records of such climate-related disasters.

But how and for whom trash gets picked up is far more complicated \u2013 and political \u2013 than it might seem on the surface. From Manila to Detroit, marginalized communities have often been left to live surrounded by garbage until community members have organized and created, or demanded, a better system. You don\u2019t have to look far to find examples of this kind of organizing in New York\u2019s own history. In the late 60s and early 70s, the Young Lords, a group of Puerto Rican activists inspired by the Black Panthers, sought to clean up East Harlem, which was infrequently serviced by garbage trucks and street sweepers. The Young Lords initially went to the local sanitation office to ask for better service, and even tried bagging up the trash themselves to make collection easier. But their requests were essentially ignored, Hiram Maristany, the Lords\u2019 official photographer, recalled later. That\u2019s when the group decided to change their strategy: they began dragging the uncollected trash into the streets, making the roads impassable for car traffic. Repeated actions of this kind, dubbed \u201cthe Garbage Offensive\u201d, eventually forced the city to respond and start cleaning up the long-neglected neighborhood.

David Holroyd, head of water quality for Wiltshire Fishery Association, said the numbers of invertebrates collected in spring and autumn samples from 2019 and 2023 at 11 sites on the upper Avon had shown a decline.

Within Africa, reports from countries including Angola and Nigeria suggest there is increasing demand in big cities, with more people dependent on the trade for income. As customs staff dig through the bags in Brussels, they confiscate all meat, as well as all fish that is not dried or gutted, free from insects and weighing less than 20kg (44lb).

{"text":"New national environment laws being developed by the Albanese government fail to address systemic flaws in the existing system and would continue to allow widespread deforestation, according to three organisations familiar with the plans. Officials representing the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, have been sharing sections of draft conservation laws to be introduced this year in consultation meetings with conservation, business and other groups. Three organisations involved in the meetings said the draft legislation did not go far enough to stop large-scale deforestation for agriculture and mining developments, or explicitly reference the need to halt the decline in threatened species, which has accelerated. In a statement ahead of the latest consultation meeting on Thursday, Environmental Justice Australia, the Wilderness Society and Environment Centre Northern Territory called for the introduction of a \u201cland-clearing trigger\u201d so developments that planned to bulldoze significant pieces of land had to be assessed by federal authorities, and not left to the states and territories. The organisations welcomed the government\u2019s commitment to establish Environment Protection Australia \u2013 a national EPA \u2013 but said they were concerned after seeing the drafts that the environment minister of the day had discretion to \u201ccall in\u201d decisions that should be left to independent experts at the EPA. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Danya Jacobs, a lawyer with Environmental Justice Australia, said the proposed legislation risked continuing a decades-long practice of environment being \u201cundermined by political interference from the mining, logging, and agricultural sectors\u201d. \u201cOne of our primary concerns is around the potential for important decisions to be influenced by political agendas rather than scientific evidence,\u201d she said.

The Environment Agency has said that most of the sites targeted by the survey were operational landfills, receiving household and commercial waste which have containment systems to prevent leachate escaping into the ground or groundwater. However, the Environment Agency says in its guidance that \u201ceven the best-engineered landfill sites will leak to some extent\u201d and states that \u201cwhile it is possible that the best of engineered landfill sites will contain and control leachate with minimal leakage, there is always a probability that some failure in engineering will occur\u201d.

Now swimmers hope that the government designating a short stretch of the river at Sheep\u2019s Green as \u201cbathing waters\u201d will provide the impetus to clean it up. The government will next month decide whether to approve up to 27 bathing water sites in England including four spots on the River Dart in Devon, two on Coniston Water in the Lake District and popular riverine swimming places on the Severn, Stour, Ribble, Thames, Tone and Wharfe. As well as encouraging increasingly popular wild swimming, supporters of the bathing waters designation say that the weekly water quality monitoring it necessitates would provide the evidence to legally require water companies to tackle pollution. Opponents argue that the water companies are already legally obliged to tackle pollution and designating polluted rivers for swimming endangers people\u2019s health and puts the onus on citizen action to correct regulatory shortcomings. At Sheep\u2019s Green, conservationists and some residents are vehemently opposed to the designation because of the impact extra visitors would have on a trio of adjacent nature reserves.

Mainly found in dense forests and on the edge of woodlands in Cuba, its eggs are the size of a coffee bean and its wings beat 80 times a second. Due to habitat destruction on the Caribbean island, scientists are concerned about its survival. \u201cIts population is thought to be declining at a rate of 20-29% a decade due to forest loss and degradation, and has already disappeared from many areas where it was formerly widespread\u201d says Dr Ian Burfield, the global science coordinator for BirdLife International. \u201cLike other hummingbirds, it feeds on nectar from a range of flowering plants and plays an important ecological role as a pollinator, so its decline is doubly concerning,\u201d he says.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/08/whos-the-smallest-of-them-all-meet-the-worlds-amazing-tiniest-creatures-aoe_1","publication_date":"2024-02-08T05:00:04Z"}}

They would not be able to claim compensation, as Tory MPs earlier this month blocked a Lib Dem amendment that would have allowed anyone who got sick as a result of illegal sewage dumping to claim from water companies. During the festive season, swimmers traditionally wear cheery fancy dress as they plunge into the sea at beaches from Eastbourne, Sussex, to St Ives, Cornwall. Statistics analysed by the Lib Dems have found that this year, festive swimmers will be using beachfronts where 4,574 hours of sewage has been spilled. Between the 32 event locations analysed by the party, almost 1,000 sewage spills were found to have occurred this year. The former party leader Tim Farron said there needed to be a ban on sewage dumping in swimming areas. In Sale, Greater Manchester, swimmers attending a Boxing Day charity event will be exposed to waters that have had 94 sewage discharges nearby. On the same day, an event in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, will expose swimmers to waters in which there have been 67 sewage discharges lasting a total of 405 hours over the last year. A New Year\u2019s Day swim location in Saunderfoot, Wales, has had 1,244 hours worth of sewage pumped into nearby waters this year.

The \u201cBlue Hole\u201d, a stretch of the south Atlantic Ocean lying approximately 200 miles off the coast of Argentina and north of the Falkland Islands, is one of the only areas of sea that is not covered by a regional fishing agreement. This has created a free-for-all, experts say, where fishing fleets can trawl the ocean, largely free from regulation or oversight. The number of vessels operating in the area has soared in recent months. According to routine monitoring carried out by the government of the Falkland Islands, at the end of January, more than 400 vessels were fishing in the Blue Hole. At the end of November, only 80 vessels had been observed. \u201cThis overwhelming unregulated activity is disastrous,\u201d said Teslyn Barkman, a member of the Falklands legislative assembly. \u201cIt\u2019s unreported, unrestricted but legal due to a lack of regional agreement as to how the area should be managed.\u201d Most of the ships were Chinese, the government said, with many turning their trackers off when entering the area, which made their activities difficult to quantify.

{"text":"The Angling Trust will now release the results of the monitoring annually, though anglers say it should not fall on volunteers to track the state of England\u2019s rivers. Cuts to the government\u2019s Environment Agency have meant, they argue, that monitoring levels have fallen. They have also complained that information about pollution remains elusive from the water industry and the agricultural sector. Ministers in England are also planning to diverge from the EU\u2019s water framework directive, which sets pollution standards for European waterways. Under the plans, the WFD would no longer be assessed as part of England\u2019s legally binding environmental targets, potentially further weakening the regulation around water quality. The targets to reduce phosphate pollution in England are already weak. Under current plans water companies could meet environmental goals by simply stripping phosphate only on their largest sewage works serving large populations and at the bottom end of rivers. This would mean that targets could be achieved with the lowest level of investment. Anglers argue that their new data shows that phosphates will still be present in the majority of rivers upstream and those with smaller wastewater works.

China, India, Korea and Europe are likely to have new reactors come on stream, while several in Japan are also forecast to return to generation, and French output should increase, according to a report on the state of global electricity markets published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) on Wednesday. Electricity demand is also expected to increase around the world, fuelled largely by the move to a low-carbon economy. Electric vehicles and heat pumps, as well as many low-carbon industrial processes, require electricity rather than oil and gas. Continuing rapid growth in renewable energy supply means these additional demands are likely to be covered in full by generation from wind, solar and other clean energy sources.

The difference, taken across the world\u2019s low- and middle-income countries, adds up to about an extra $37bn lost to women from heat stress and $16bn extra from floods each year.

But officials said they were unable to rescue the animal because of high winds and surf in Gulf of Mexico waters off Venice\u2019s coast, and they had to euthanize the animal. Rescuers had hoped conditions would be more favorable on Monday, allowing them to save the whale. But it became clear on Sunday evening that the whale was experiencing labored breathing and suffering, officials said. The animal died about 3am Monday. Police said they maintained a presence near the whale throughout its final night. The animal beached on a sandbar about 50 yards (45m) from Service Club Park in Venice, Florida, the local police department said in posts on Facebook. Authorities estimated that the whale weighed between 50,000 and 70,000lb.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/11/florida-sperm-whale-stranded-dies_0","publication_date":"2024-03-11T16:05:01Z"}}

In Wisconsin, where testing of game meat is voluntary, Anderson and Osterholm say many thousands of people have probably eaten meat from infected deer. Wyoming serves as a reference point for other states. Since 1997, there have been 92,000 tissue samples collected and tested there, said Breanna Ball, of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. Last year, the meat from 6,701 deer, elk and moose was tested. Disease was present in about 800 samples, suggesting infection rates are rising.

{"text":"After promising early dumps of snow in some areas of Europe this autumn, the pattern of recent years resumed and rain and sleet took over. In the ski resorts of Morzine and Les Gets in the French Alps, the heavy rainfall meant that full opening of resorts was delayed until two days before Christmas, leaving the industry and the millions of tourists planning trips to stare at the sky in hope. But no amount of wishing and hoping will overcome what is an existential threat to skiing in the Alps, an industry worth $30bn (\u00a323.8bn) that provides the most popular ski destination in the world. The science is clear, and is spelled out in carefully weighed-up peer reviewed reports. The most recent, this year, warned that at 2C of global heating above pre-industrial levels, 53% of the 28 European resorts examined would be at very high risk of a scarce amount of snow. Scarce snow has been defined as the poorest coverage seen on average every five years between 1961 and 1990. If the world were to hit 4C of heating, 98% of the resorts would be at very high risk of scarce snow cover. Another study has revealed the way in which snow cover in the Alps has had an \u201cunprecedented\u201d decline over the past 600 years, with the duration of the cover now shorter by 36 days. Some respond by holding on to the idea that skiing will and can survive if global temperatures are kept to the limits set by the Paris agreement, and if the industry adapts. But rumblings of discontent at the lack of action to ensure the survival of the sport by the International Ski Federation (FIS) broke into the open this year.","meta":{"id":"environment/2023/dec/26/ski-resorts-battle-for-a-future-as-snow-declines-in-climate-crisis_0","publication_date":"2023-12-26T07:25:56Z"}}

For 33 years his job with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute monitoring the region\u2019s climate has given him a front-row seat to how the weather\u2019s familiar patterns have changed, upending axioms of old and calling into question the future viability of one of the most important trade routes in the world.

Now, with warnings that the situation is set to get much worse, experts say that the effects of a restricted Panama Canal could be felt all over the world. Connecting the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, the canal revolutionised global shipping when it opened in 1914, eliminating the need to travel around the dangerous southern tip of South America, shortening the trip by more than 13,000km. In 2022, more than 14,000 ships traversed the canal, transporting fuel, grain, minerals and goods from the factories of east Asia to the consumers of New York and beyond. More than 40% of consumer goods traded between north-east Asia and the US east coast are transported through the canal. To make the journey, ships \u2013 some up to 350 metres long \u2013 enter through a narrow waterway and rise more than 26 metres above sea level into the man-made Lake Gatun through a series of locks. On the other side of the canal, the process is reversed and the ships descend to sea level through another series of locks before exiting the canal on the other side of the continent. The locking system relies on fresh water from Lake Gatun and another nearby reservoir to function.","meta":{"id":"environment/2023/dec/22/changing-climate-casts-a-shadow-over-the-future-of-the-panama-canal-and-global-trade_0","publication_date":"2023-12-22T01:01:41Z"}}
{"text":"Industry could be producing more cancer-causing PCB chemicals today than at any other point in history, despite their production having been banned more than 40 years ago. PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, are human-made substances that were used as coolants and lubricants in electrical equipment until they were banned due to their links to health problems and because they do not break down easily in the environment. They are known to cause cancer in animals as well as damage to the immune, reproductive, nervous and endocrine systems. They also have the potential to be carcinogenic in humans and exposure to them has been linked to acne-like skin conditions in adults and neurobehavioural and immunological changes in children. Research seen by the Guardian and Watershed Investigations shows that PCBs are being produced as byproducts in chemical reactions, which means small proportions of them are present in many chemicals used today. \u201cThis is staggering given that production of PCBs was banned over 40 years ago and we are supposed to be eliminating them under the Stockholm convention,\u201d said the environmental forensic scientist Dr Dave Megson from Manchester Metropolitan University, who conducted the study. \u201cWhen we take into account the volumes of these chemicals and the small levels of PCBs within them then this adds up to a massive number \u2013 around 45,000 tonnes per year in the US alone.\u201d During peak commercial production in the 1970s about 39,000 tonnes were made each year, states the study. \u201cMost people associate this accidental production of PCBs with paints and pigments, but our research shows it\u2019s much broader than that,\u201d said Megson.

The capital city of the eastern province of Punjab, near the Indian border, has some of the worst air quality in the world and has become extremely polluted because of a growing population of more than 13 million people. By early December, the air quality in the city had grown so bad that schools, markets and parks were closed for four days. By last weekend, the city\u2019s air quality index (AQI) had reached levels considered extremely hazardous to health. To try to reduce them, on Saturday the Punjab government used cloud seeding to create rain in 10 locations around the city using a small Cessna plane. To create the clouds, there needs to be enough moisture already present in the clouds in the lower atmosphere. In summer, common table salt mixed with water is sprayed over the cloud patches from planes. After a few hours, the mist integrates with the clouds and produces rain. In winter, the clouds are seeded using flakes of silver iodide, which can be fired from a vehicle or a plane.

While this is partly a response to the difficulty of studying it, it also reflects an ingrained tendency. As the writer Robert Macfarlane has observed, humans are creatures of the air and light, and we have often regarded the spaces beneath our feet with abhorrence, associating them with death, entombment and the unseen and unnameable. And while what Macfarlane calls the underland might be a place of ritual power as well as a place of burial, the ocean\u2019s depths are more frequently equated with loss and forgetting. Although those versed in traditional wayfinding techniques often understood the ocean in more complex ways, the idea of the deep as an unknowable non-place was also embedded in navigational practices. For European sailors plying the waters of the Mediterranean sea and the Atlantic and Indian oceans, all that really mattered was knowing where potential obstacles and risks such as reefs and sandbars lay \u2013 a way of thinking that transformed the ocean\u2019s depths into a blank irrelevance. It was not until the early 19th century that a more detailed scientific understanding of the deep began to take shape. In part, this was a result of the growing reach of the colonial powers: as the commercial and territorial aspirations of Europeans and Americans expanded to encompass the globe, the need for more accurate and more detailed knowledge of the ocean grew as well. But it also grew out of the experiences of whalers, whose voyages were now taking them far out into the open waters of the Atlantic and Pacific, and leading to an appreciation of the great depths to which whales would often dive. This interest in the deep ocean took on a new urgency in the 1850s, when British and American entrepreneurs began to lay the first submarine telegraph cables across the Atlantic.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/12/radioactive-waste-baby-bottles-and-spam-the-deep-ocean-has-become-a-dumping-ground_0","publication_date":"2024-03-12T05:00:58Z"}}

{"text":"No new proposals for general-use windfarms were submitted for planning permission in England last year, despite the government\u2019s much-vaunted relaxation of planning restrictions. Only seven applications were submitted for onshore wind turbines for the whole of 2023 in England, new data from the government has shown, and all of those developments were for the replacement of existing turbines or for private sites, where the energy produced is destined for a particular consumer, such as a business. The number was even lower than the 10 applications submitted in 2022, when the de facto ban was still in force. Four onshore wind developments were granted planning permission in England last year from prior applications, all of which were either turbine replacements or for private use, and work began on one 4MW project in Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire, which had received permission the year before. Last September, ministers announced changes to the restrictive regulations that had in effect ruled out onshore wind turbine construction in England since 2015, brought in by David Cameron to appease rightwing Conservatives. Rishi Sunak agreed to amend the regulations last year under pressure from his backbenchers who were concerned about the impact of the ban on energy prices. But campaigners pointed out that the relaxation of the ban was only partial, and warned it was likely to be ineffective. Data released in December showed that no new plans had been submitted since the change of rules in September, and additional data released this week confirmed the absence of applications for onshore windfarms that would serve for general public use. By contrast, at least 46 applications for onshore wind development applications were made over the same period in Scotland, where no such ban has ever been imposed. Chaitanya Kumar, head of environment and green transition at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, who analysed the government data, said the findings showed that the government was failing to harness the opportunities of onshore wind energy generation, which could bring down electricity bills and displace some of the need for expensive gas.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/15/zero-plans-for-public-onshore-windfarms-submitted-last-year-in-england_0","publication_date":"2024-02-15T17:27:19Z"}}

Analysis of the government\u2019s renewable energy planning database shows that no applications for new onshore wind projects have been submitted since the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, claimed that the government would overturn the onshore wind ban in September 2023. At the time, the National Infrastructure Commission advised the government to go further and restore onshore wind to the government\u2019s Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects process, which would encourage more applications. The government rejected this recommendation and said the measures announced in September were enough. Analysis by Carbon Brief estimates that if onshore wind had continued to be built at the same rate it was in 2017 \u2013 before the ban started to come into effect \u2013 7GW of onshore wind would have been built.

Last September, a year after Dolly\u2019s death, von der Leyen announced plans that to some wolf-defenders looked like revenge: the commission wants to reduce the wolf\u2019s legal protection. Action had already been taken against Dolly\u2019s killer. DNA evidence harvested from the pony\u2019s carcass revealed that the wolf was an individual known as GW950m. This mature male wolf, which heads a pack (a wolf family usually numbering eight to 10) living around the von der Leyen residence, appears to have developed a taste for livestock. DNA tests on other carcasses implicates him in the deaths of about 70 sheep, horses, cattle and goats.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/27/a-wolf-killed-the-eu-presidents-precious-pony-then-the-fight-to-catch-the-predator-began_0","publication_date":"2024-01-27T12:00:37Z"}}

Mirroring patterns found elsewhere in the natural world, researchers have discovered that a few tree species dominate the world\u2019s major rainforests, with thousands of rare species making up the rest. Led by University College London researchers and published in the Nature journal, the international collaboration of 356 scientists uncovered almost identical patterns of tree diversity across the world\u2019s rainforests, which are the most biodiverse places on the planet. The researchers estimate that just 1,000 species account for half of Earth\u2019s 800 billion trees in tropical rainforests, with 46,000 species making up the remainder. \u201cOur findings have profound implications for understanding tropical forests.

The legally binding environment targets are a part of the Environment Act 2021, which was passed to replace EU law. Countries in the bloc can be sanctioned by the EU if they fall behind on environmental standards, but now the UK has left this is the only way ministers are held to account for protecting the environment.

{"text":"The widespread use of PCBs meant large quantities were released into the environment, but the effect of that did not become apparent until the 1950s, when the Danish scientist So\u0308ren Jensen found traces of them in pike caught in Sweden. Over the next two years, Jensen detected trace of PCBs everywhere: in fish, in birds \u2013 even in the bodies of his wife and daughter. In the decades since Jensen\u2019s discovery, PCBs have been banned or regulated in many countries. But that does not mean they have disappeared. Instead, as the discovery of high concentrations of them in the bodies of amphipods recovered from the bottom of the Mariana and Kermadec trenches demonstrates, they have simply migrated into deeper waters. Exactly what this will mean is not yet fully understood. PCBs are highly toxic in even tiny doses, causing cancer, liver damage and deformities in many species as well as disturbing hormonal balances in fish, birds and mammals, and have been linked to neurological disorders in birds. Because PCBs collect in fatty tissues they also accumulate as they move up the food chain, thus concentrating in the bodies of long-lived, high-level predators such as sharks, seals and whales, where they have been implicated in mass die-offs of dolphins, and are known to result in increased mortality in whales and dolphins, who transfer high concentrations of them to their young in their milk. Worse yet, PCBs break down extremely slowly when kept out of the sunlight, meaning they can linger in the deep ocean and the bodies of animals for decades or even longer. Like the slow decay of the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of nuclear waste spread across the sea floor, the toxic legacies of human industry written into the bodies of ocean creatures are a reminder that the deep is not a place of forgetting, but an ark of memory.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/12/radioactive-waste-baby-bottles-and-spam-the-deep-ocean-has-become-a-dumping-ground_9","publication_date":"2024-03-12T05:00:58Z"}}

Without the tax subsidies, largely provided to the most fuel-intensive section of the fleet, many sectors would be unprofitable, according to the analysis by government environmental advisers. Globally, fuel subsidies to the fishing industry were estimated at $8bn (\u00a36.3bn) in 2018, and represented a third of all harmful fishing subsidies, the authors said, adding that they were a key factor in the widespread depletion of fish populations, more than a third of which are overfished. Fuel-tax concessions for the UK industry amounted to \u00a3150m-\u00a3180m a year, from 2009 to 2019, according to the analysis of industry data, which was published in the journal Marine Policy last autumn. They amount to between 15% and 18% of the industry\u2019s income, which was worth \u00a31bn last year.

In 2020, the Frozen Zoo used cryopreserved DNA to clone a black-footed ferret, the first endangered species in the United States to be cloned. Last year, frozen cells cryopreserved 42 years ago were used to clone two critically endangered Przewalski\u2019s wild horses, bringing valuable genetic diversity back to the living population that will make it more resilient to new illnesses or environmental threats.

{"text":"A shift towards a more sustainable global food system could create up to $10tn (\u00a37.9tn) of benefits a year, improve human health and ease the climate crisis, according to the most comprehensive economic study of its type. It found that existing food systems destroyed more value than they created due to hidden environmental and medical costs, in effect, borrowing from the future to take profits today. Food systems drive a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, putting the world on course for 2.7C of warming by the end of the century. This creates a vicious cycle, as higher temperatures bring more extreme weather and greater damage to harvests. Food insecurity also puts a burden on medical systems. The study predicted a business-as-usual approach would leave 640 million people underweight by 2050, while obesity would increase by 70%. Redirecting the food system would be politically challenging but bring huge economic and welfare benefits, said the international team of authors behind the study, which aims to be the food equivalent of the Stern review, the 2006 examination of the costs of climate change. Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and one of the study\u2019s authors, said: \u201cThe global food system holds the future of humanity on Earth in its hand.\u201d The study proposes a shift of subsidies and tax incentives away from destructive large-scale monocultures that rely on fertilisers, pesticides and forest clearance.

The swallowtail is among hundreds of freshwater animals and plants in Britain\u2019s smallest but most biodiverse national park which are imperilled by global heating. Summer droughts and sea level rise are causing saltwater to enter the freshwater Broads, while winter floods are covering marshland with water for prolonged periods, threatening many rare species.

The EU built record levels of solar panels and wind turbines in 2023, according to industry data, and was able to make more electricity from dams and nuclear power plants that had been struck by drought and repair work the year before. The report found that lower demand for electricity, aided by good weather, contributed to 8% of the fall in fossil CO2 emissions. Cuts in sectors such as industry \u2013 where high gas prices have led some firms to become more efficient and others to make fewer goods \u2013 and transport made up the remaining 36%.

{"text":"Misguided tree-planting projects are threatening crucial ecosystems across Africa, scientists have warned. Research has revealed that an area the size of France is threatened by forest restoration initiatives that are taking place in inappropriate landscapes. One project in particular, the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative, aims to plant trees across 100m hectares (247m acres) of land by 2030. Scientists have warned that the scheme plans to plant trees in non-forest ecosystems such as savannahs and grasslands, potentially disrupting or destroying intact ecosystems. The research found that 52% of tree-planting projects in Africa are occurring in savannahs, with almost 60% using non-native tree species, which also brings the risk of introducing invasive species. The researchers say the misclassification of grassy ecosystems including savannahs as \u201cforests\u201d could lead to misplaced reforestation and destruction of these ancient grasslands. The definition currently used by the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization defines forests as areas of land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 metres, with tree canopy cover of at least 10%. Under this definition, open-spaced ecosystems with trees, such as savannahs, would be classified as forests and would meet the required standards for reforestation \u2013 even if they were not appropriate. The addition of more trees to these areas creates more canopy cover and decreases the amount of light that can reach the ground below, which can change the grassy environment of the savannah. This could be a risk to wildlife such as rhinos and wildebeest, as well as people who depend on these ecosystems.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/15/ill-judged-tree-planting-africa-threatens-ecosystems-scientists-warn_0","publication_date":"2024-02-15T19:00:22Z"}}

{"text":"Better water quality and the creation of new habitats in former gravel pits around Norwich caused the dragonfly to thrive in those areas. The BDS has said climate breakdown may have contributed to its expansion beyond Norfolk and Suffolk, with warmer temperatures causing it to go north and west of its previous limits. Scientists are concerned that the dragonfly may go extinct in East Anglia because its breeding sites will be lost to the sea if levels rise. The new colonies are farther inland and do not face such risks. Dr Pam Taylor, the convener of the BDS dragonfly conservation group, said: \u201cAlthough the hawker\u2019s overall range has expanded greatly, there are still huge gaps in its current distribution. It will need to infill many of these gaps before the species is truly secure in this country and only time will tell whether it will succeed.\u201d The dragonfly conservationists said other species were declining because of climate breakdown. The State of Dragonflies in Britain and Ireland 2021 report showed that upland and heathland species had faced the most noticeable declines, particularly in England, and the climate crisis was believed to be the main cause. As drought became more prevalent, the pools and small streams in which many dragonflies bred were expected to dry up. For example, the small red damselfly disappeared from Scarning Fen, in Norfolk, last year after the record-breaking hot summer of 2022.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/26/norfolk-hawker-dragonfly-no-longer-endangered-scientists-say_1","publication_date":"2024-02-26T12:20:24Z"}}

Since then, as global heating has intensified, some have experienced entirely ice-free winters. \u201cThe Great Lakes are now experiencing much lower ice cover, but in many regions, no ice at all. Large and deep lakes, including bays in Lakes Michigan and Superior, are most likely to permanently lose ice cover as soon as the 2060s if greenhouse gas emissions are not mitigated,\u201d said Sharma. The depth and breadth of the water system means what happens in the Great Lakes doesn\u2019t stay in the Great Lakes. In years with less or no ice cover, the lakes experience higher evaporation rates, warmer water and lower oxygen levels, making it harder for native coldwater fish to thrive and causing a knock-on effect on the entire food chain. Increased evaporation rates lead to lower water levels and fewer wetlands in the surrounding areas, adding stress on animal species already struggling to find food and adapt to warmer temperatures. The snow and ice are key to Great Lakes culture and tourism, and the region boasts outdoor activities such as tobogganing, outdoor skating, dog sledding and ice fishing, as well as a multibillion-dollar snow removal industry. In warmer winters recreational activities are canceled, tourism takes a hit and drownings rise due to the unstable ice.

Guy Shrubsole, the campaigner and author of The Lost Rainforests of Britain, is urging the authorities to take action to save this unique fragment of ancient temperate forest. \u201cOvergrazing by sheep is preventing any saplings and young trees from growing on the edge of this amazing temperate rainforest, and without new trees Black-a-Tor Copse will eventually die,\u201d said Shrubsole. \u201cWe urgently need the landowner, the national park and the conservation authorities to step in and save this unique and special place.\u201d Alongside the renowned Wistman\u2019s Wood, Black-a-Tor Copse is one of only three ancient high-altitude oak woodlands on Dartmoor, a habitat that is home to a plethora of spectacular bryophytes, lichens, and rare invertebrates including the ash-black slug and the blue ground beetle. Because Black-a-Tor Copse\u2019s oaks are growing in a severe moorland environment more than 360 metres above sea level, the trees do not stretch much above six metres in height and are twisted by the wind. The 29-hectare nature reserve is a site of special scientific interest and an enigmatic relic of woodland that once covered much more of the steep-sided valleys across Dartmoor and far-western England. Centuries of intensive grazing by cattle, sheep and ponies have left only tiny patches of woodland, which have mostly survived only because the trees grow out of boulder fields, where the large granite stones give young saplings some protection from livestock grazing. Despite its rarity, Black-a-Tor Copse is unfenced and scores of sheep grazed on the adjacent commons wander into it, constantly nibbling the trees and ground flora.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/01/save-dartmoor-rainforest-black-a-tor-copse-from-sheep-urge-campaigners_0","publication_date":"2024-03-01T13:00:12Z"}}
