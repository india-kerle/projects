{"text":"The worst air in Europe is found in central and eastern countries, as well as in Italy, but a Guardian investigation in September found that 98% of Europeans breathe air so dirty it breaches WHO limits. The European Council has proposed that countries with a high share of low-income households and a GDP per person below the EU average should be allowed to hit limit values as late as 2040, because they have less money to invest in cleaning up. Many poorer European countries have dirty air because they stoke power plants with more coal to make electricity, burn more wood and coal to heat homes, and have older cars and factories. The scientists said that \u201cusing poverty as an excuse to fail to act is the exact opposite of what these countries need\u201d. It would be better for human health in these countries to set laws and provide money to speed up \u201curgently needed\u201d clean air policies, they added. \u201cWe need fair and ambitious new EU air quality legislation that values the health of all Europeans equally,\u201d said Zorana Jovanovic Andersen, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Copenhagen and chair of the ERS environment and health committee. \u201cChildren and adults in eastern European countries have already been breathing the most polluted air in Europe \u2013 and suffering from related lung diseases \u2013 for far too long.\u201d Bad air hurts economies because it means people take more sick days off work and need more treatment in hospital.

{"text":"Last year was the hottest ever reliably recorded globally by a blistering margin, US scientists have confirmed, leaving researchers struggling to account for the severity of the heat and what it portends for the unfolding climate crisis. Last year was the world\u2019s hottest in records that stretch back to 1850, according to analyses released concurrently by Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) on Friday, with a record high in ocean temperatures and a new low in Antarctic sea ice extent. Noaa calculated that last year\u2019s global temperature was 1.35C (2.4F) hotter, on average, than the pre-industrial era, which is slightly less than the 1.48C (2.6F) increase that EU scientists, who also found 2023 was the hottest on record, came up with due to slightly different methodologies. A separate analysis of 2023 released on Friday by Berkeley Earth has the year at 1.54C above pre-industrial times, which is above the 1.5C (2.7F) warming limit that countries have agreed to keep to in order to avoid disastrous global heating impacts. This guardrail will need to be broken on a consistent basis, rather than one year, to be considered fully breached, however. The burning of fossil fuels and deforestation has driven the extraordinary warmth, which follows a string of hotter-than-average years in recent decades. Each decade over the past 40 years has been warmer than the last, Noaa said, with the most recent 10 years all making up the hottest 10 years ever recorded. Last year\u2019s record heat was further spurred by El Ni\u00f1o, a periodic climatic event that heats up parts of the Pacific Ocean and heightens global temperatures. However, even with these known factors scientists were left stunned at the severity of 2023, which was initially following the expected long-term warming pattern before seeing record after record obliterated in the second half of the year. Last year beat the previous temperature record, set in 2016, by 0.15C (0.27F), Noaa said, which is a huge margin in climate terms.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/12/2023-hottest-year-record-us-scientists_0","publication_date":"2024-01-12T16:05:51Z"}}

{"text":"The EU aims to slash its net greenhouse gas pollution by 90% by 2040 as part of its push to become the world\u2019s first climate-neutral continent, the European Commission has announced before elections in June. Under a landmark proposal laid out by its executive body on Tuesday, the bloc will have to pump 90% less planet-heating gas into the air by 2040 than it did in 1990, a figure which includes the carbon it removes from the atmosphere. The target is at the bottom end of the 90-95% net cuts that the EU\u2019s scientific watchdog recommended in June, and meeting it would require a much faster shift to a clean economy. In the three decades between 1990 and 2021, the EU\u2019s 27 member states cut their emissions by just 30%, according to the European Environment Agency, leaving them half as long to do twice the work. Wopke Hoekstra, the EU climate commissioner, said the target sent a message to the world that Europe \u201ccontinues to lead the way\u201d on climate action. \u201cTackling the climate crisis is a marathon, not a sprint. We need to make sure everyone crosses the finish line and nobody is left behind,\u201d he said. The target, which is a recommendation for the next commission after European elections in June, is part of a bid to stop extreme weather from growing more violent. But some of the individual targets were scrapped at the last minute because of protests from farmers that have seen politicians in the EU and its member states row back on plans to make farms pollute less.

Two small Texas ranches at the center of that case have also filed a federal lawsuit against Synagro, alleging the company knew its sludge was contaminated but still sold it.

We looked more into it and found that there wasn\u2019t much data on how much particle pollution was released by wood-burning equipment into homes.\u201d Martins and his team started by measuring air pollution from stoves and fireplaces in a small number of homes. This data was used in computer simulations of three homes in north-west Europe: in Birmingham, Groningen and Copenhagen, and combined with data from the health effects of outdoor air pollution. Heating a living-room open fireplace for four hours each winter\u2019s evening was estimated to shorten the occupant\u2019s life expectancy by between one and 1.6 years. Using a stove could reduce overall life expectancy by up to six months. This comes with important caveats. Indoor and outdoor air pollution have different sources; chemical composition and exposure.

People are just fully dependent on access to wild and feral pigs for their protein needs,\u201d said Meijaard. The disappearance of this key protein source puts pressure on other species: in the absence of pigs, millions of local people were likely to shift their focus to hunting endangered species such as pig-tailed macaques, the scientists warned. The loss of wild pigs can also affect the ecosystem as a whole. Bearded pigs disperse the seeds of trees as they eat fruits and migrate large distances, defecating them out throughout the forest. They also turn over soil with their snouts, which cleans undergrowth and gives tree roots access to more soil nutrients.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/19/african-swine-fever-asian-wild-pigs-borneo-aoe_1","publication_date":"2024-01-19T06:00:21Z"}}

The massive environmental impact of eating meat has been well established, and the study reinforced this, with meat dishes scoring more than vegetarian or vegan dishes across almost all locally and globally produced scenarios.

The stripping of Earth\u2019s natural materials is already responsible for 60% of global heating impacts, including land use change, 40% of air pollution impact, and more than 90% of global water stress and land-related biodiversity loss, says the report, due to be released in February.

Research by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, commissioned by Greenpeace, shows sea-level rise is likely to permanently submerge parts of the island by 2050, a problem exacerbated by the loss of coral reefs as a natural buffer against the oceans warming and acidifying. The studies also concluded that the climate crisis would exacerbate health problems on the island and could ruin its cultural heritage and tourism industry. Bonaire is a popular diving destination, and the degradation of coral reefs could lead to the loss of the majority of dive sites, which it is estimated will reduce visitor numbers by more than 100,000. The group of islanders, most of whom still live on Bonaire and are Dutch citizens, want the Netherlands to tighten its climate goals, so it contributes its \u201cfair share\u201d to keep global heating below 1.5C above preindustrial levels, which would involve reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 \u2013 10 years earlier than its current target.

Eefje de Kroon, the climate justice expert at Greenpeace Netherlands who is working on the case, noted that the Netherlands is known for its advanced water-management strategies on the mainland, but the government has done very little to study how the climate crisis will affect its Caribbean outposts and how they could be protected.

So while some are pushing for the industry to do more to adapt to keep the sport alive, others are working to embrace a new future rather than concentrating everything on the one sport. In Morzine, the non-profit sustainability Montagne Verte group is working at grassroots level to support a move to a low-carbon future in the area. C\u00e9cile Burton, general manager of Montagne Verte, said: \u201cTemperatures in the Alps are rising at more than twice the global average and that is not good news for an industry dependent on snow. \u201cOur approach is to focus on four-season tourism in the valley and to make the valley and mountains somewhere you can live all year. \u201cThere is life after skiing but we have to adapt and we have to imagine what our future will look like. This is an area where you can climb, mountain bike, walk, or just be in the environment and that is all year round. \u201cWe need to put more value in other times of the year not only from an environmental and sustainability perspective but from a human perspective because for somewhere to be a place you can live in all year round you have to have employment all year round.\u201d","meta":{"id":"environment/2023/dec/26/ski-resorts-battle-for-a-future-as-snow-declines-in-climate-crisis_3","publication_date":"2023-12-26T07:25:56Z"}}
{"text":"The shadow cabinet and Labour\u2019s top advisers are considering whether to alter or even abandon the longstanding pledge to increase public investment in the low-carbon economy to \u00a328bn a year in the second half of the next parliament. The Tory party has made the pledge its key attack line against Labour, claiming that the only way the party will be able to make such investments is by raising taxes. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is expected to attempt to reinforce this by cutting some taxes in the budget in March, further reducing the fiscal headroom an incoming Labour government would have to increase spending, unless it rowed back on his cuts. The Tories also argue that their plans, which include scaling up fossil fuels by issuing more oil and gas licences, are already attracting private sector investment. Private sector investment in the UK\u2019s low-carbon economy since 2010 stands at \u00a3200bn, with \u00a330bn of that coming since September, mainly in offshore wind. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThis shows huge confidence in the UK, and our plans will see a further \u00a3100bn [in private sector investment] by 2030, helping to support up to 480,000 jobs.\u201d A Whitehall source said the government\u2019s roadmaps on industries such as nuclear power, carbon capture and hydrogen were \u201cproviding industry with the certainty they need to back low-carbon projects in the UK\u201d.

{"text":"In a year of record-breaking temperatures and marine heatwaves threatening our already depleted seas, conservationists, supermarkets and even musicians, including Icelandic singer Bj\u00f6rk, have spoken out over dwindling wild fish populations. Oceana, a US-based NGO, reported that half of Britain\u2019s largest wild fish populations, including North Sea cod, are either overfished or in a critical state; supermarkets criticised the UK, Norway and EU for failure to reach agreement over sustainable mackerel fishing; and Blue Marine Foundation, another charity, is taking the UK government to court for \u201cillegally squandering\u201d fish populations by ignoring scientific advice on those shared with the EU and Norway. The welfare of farmed fish, as well as the impact of the fish farming industry, has also taken a hit. The naturalist and broadcaster Chris Packham called for a halt to the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d expansion of the Scottish salmon farming industry, as the Guardian revealed farmed salmon mortality was at record levels. Most salmon bought in UK supermarkets are farmed. And earlier this month, an expert assessment of wild fish populations found nearly a quarter at risk of extinction, with wild Atlantic salmon increasingly threatened. So, what are the fish to ditch in 2024 and what should we eating? \u201cUnsustainable seafood is one of the biggest threats to our seas,\u201d says Charlotte Coombes, good fish guide manager at the Marine Conservation Society (MCS).

{"text":"The Conservatives have been accused by human rights experts of hypocrisy after cracking down on climate and Gaza protests while celebrating and endorsing farmers\u2019 protests in Wales. Rishi Sunak joined a protest of farmers in Wales last Friday, after they had obstructed a road while campaigning against the Labour government\u2019s new farming subsidies scheme. But this week he vowed to crack down on protests, referring to them as \u201cmob rule\u201d. On Wednesday, the Welsh Conservative leader, Andrew Davies, along with many of his colleagues greeted and posed for photographs with farmers who formed a large group outside the Senedd and blocked a main road with tractors. Meanwhile, climate protesters were arrested while marching through the City of London to demand insurance companies stop insuring fossil fuel projects. At a climate protest outside the London headquarters of the Axa insurance group on Thursday, police told protesters who stood in the road they would be liable for arrest for interfering with vital national infrastructure, a new offence under the Public Order Act 2023 that allows them to criminalise anyone blocking a road. In recent years, the government has tightened legislation specifically to stop climate protesters from blocking roads, and dozens have been imprisoned as a result. This week, Sunak announced a range of measures to stop protesters from obstructing the homes or workplaces of politicians \u2013 including their parliaments. However, on Wednesday in parliament he offered support to the Welsh farmers who had gathered in their thousands outside the Welsh parliament. Yasmine Ahmed, UK director of Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cThe idea that politicians are celebrating one set of protesters while cracking down on others is chilling.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/mar/01/tories-accused-of-hypocrisy-farmers-protests-crackdown-climate-gaza_0","publication_date":"2024-03-01T06:00:48Z"}}

The young salmon fry were released amid the largest dam removal project in US history along the 257-mile-long river, which flows across Oregon and California. Four hydropower dams are being removed, reconnecting the lower and upper portions of the Klamath River for the first time in a century and allowing fish free passage along the river. The removal is the result of a decades-long campaign by tribes, environmentalists and fishers to restore the river and its ecosystem to their natural state. One dam has been fully demolished and three others are scheduled to come down this year. Last week, the California department of fish and wildlife (CDFW) released 830,000 hatchery-raised fall-run Chinook, only to discover days later that they were dying downstream of the 173ft Iron Gate dam, which is scheduled to be demolished soon. A tunnel at the dam\u2019s base had been opened to allow the river to pass freely across it for the first time in a century, a step before the structure could be fully removed. Many of the young fish, which were only 1-2in long, appear to have died passing through that tunnel, because the water pressure inside was too great for them. Officials do not know exactly how many of the fry have died, but expect a \u201cvery high mortality rate\u201d, according to Jordan Traverso, deputy director of communications for the CDFW.

There, near Stara bridge, is a favourite place, dating from childhood when my younger sister and I stayed with our paternal grandparents. At the hamlet of Darley, close to Notter Tor with its overgrown quarries and mine shafts, overlooked by the shadowy profile of Cheesewring quarry, my grandfather cultivated a garden with fruit and vegetables, milked two South Devon cows, kept hens and rotated a few bullocks in little stony pastures. Occasionally he rode towards the moor on his chestnut mare, Gaiety. Until a borehole was divined and installed, the house was plumbed with rainwater collected from the roof; we helped carry pitchers and covered buckets of drinking water pumped from a nearby well. Familiar narrow lanes, edged in granite hedge banks clothed in dripping mosses, pennywort and ferns, wind downhill. Before the onset of this recent dry spell, these ways ran as streams, channelling excessive run-off and detritus from enlarged and waterlogged fields towards the river, unusually high and swollen with water from the eastern side of the moor.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/18/country-diary-walking-the-familiar-lanes-of-my-childhood_0","publication_date":"2024-01-18T05:30:01Z"}}

There are four species: three from Asia and one that lives along the east coast of North America. The last is the main source of crabs for bleeding. The blood of horseshoes contains cells that are exceptionally sensitive to toxic bacteria. When those cells meet invading micro-organisms, they form clots and so protect the rest of the horseshoe crab\u2019s body, a phenomenon that scientists exploited to develop the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test in the 1970s. This can determine if medical products, such as vaccines, have been contaminated with dangerous bacteria. To obtain supplies of the blood needed to make these tests, hundreds of thousands of horseshoe crabs are gathered every year. Their blood is extracted and the animals are then returned to their shoreline homes. One estimate, made in 2021, suggested that of 718,809 horseshoe crabs collected for these bleedings, a total of 112,104 died, around 15%.

It was also greater in the mornings, perhaps due to greater emissions when petrol engines are started from cold. This may directly produce particle pollution.

{"text":"A commitment to restoration is essential, according to Inger Andersen, executive director of UNEP, who noted it was no longer enough to merely protect what was left of Africa\u2019s fertile land. This continent will be home to a quarter of the world\u2019s population in little more than a generation and many areas have already degraded into semi-barren drylands. \u201cInitiatives like TREES are playing an important role in reversing decades of ecosystem degradation, especially across the Sahel, pushing back desertification, increasing climate resilience and improving the wellbeing of farmers and their communities,\u201d Andersen said in announcing the World Restoration Flagship. While there is no doubt about the need for reforestation, there are historical reasons to be sceptical about the effectiveness of such programmes. Expectations are often too high. A 2019 study suggesting the climate crisis could be significantly eased by planting a trillion trees across the world was later debunked as unrealistic because there was not enough suitable land. Many governments have launched mass tree-planting campaigns, but after the initial day or two of publicity, there is rarely sufficient irrigation, protection and other follow-up to ensure seeds and saplings grow into trunks and branches. Often such national initiatives are little more than greenwashing distractions from far greater forest destruction elsewhere. Kenya, for example, has launched numerous tree-planting initiatives in recent decades, including the Million Operation Gavisha in 1977, the Trees Campaign in 2006, the Greening Kenya Initiative in 2010 and the Accelerated National Tree Growing Campaign 2022, yet overall, it has lost 11% of its tree cover since 2000.

{"text":"Children with more green space near their homes have significantly stronger bones, a study has found, potentially leading to lifelong health benefits. Scientists found that the children living in places with 20-25% more natural areas had increased bone strength that was equivalent to half a year\u2019s natural growth. The study, the first of its kind, also found that the risk of having very low bone density was about 65% lower for these children. Bone strength grows in childhood and adolescence, before plateauing until about the age of 50 and then declining. Increasing the size and accessibility of green spaces for children could therefore prevent fractures and osteoporosis in older people, the researchers said. The link between green spaces and stronger bones is likely to result from higher levels of physical activity in children who live near parks, as this spurs bone growth. The connection was strongest for green spaces with trees, which the scientists said may be because these were more attractive places to visit. \u201cThe stronger the bone mass is during childhood, the more capacity you have for later in life,\u201d said Prof Tim Nawrot, at Hasselt University in Belgium, who was part of the study team with Dr Hanne Sleurs and others. \u201cSo the real public health message from this study is that urban planners can make stronger bones of children, and that has long-lasting consequences.\u201d Previous research has found greater access to green spaces increases physical activity in children.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/jan/13/children-living-near-green-spaces-tronger-bones-study_0","publication_date":"2024-01-13T06:00:07Z"}}

It is working with farmers to improve protection of the catchment area from effluent and agricultural drainage water. Simon Evans, chief executive of the foundation, said: \u2018Many of the challenges we are trying to resolve are the legacy of historic poor planning decisions, such as when the planners have insisted the units be located too close to watercourses. \u201cIn some cases, the solutions are not obvious and require careful consideration along with guidance from regulators.

{"text":"The team is investigating the consequences for the marine ecosystem: from nutrient cycling to ice algae and plankton productivity to seafloor animal communities that live on organic material raining down from the surface ocean. An ice core drilled from sea ice in the central Arctic Ocean The central Arctic is heating up much faster than most of the world. The area covered by sea ice in the Arctic Ocean at the end of summer has shrunk by about 40%, or 2.5m square kilometres \u2013 roughly the size of the Mediterranean Sea \u2013 since satellite observations began in the late 1970s. The remaining ice is getting thinner and multi-year floes \u2013 ice that has survived at least one summer \u2013 are becoming rarer. The waters around the north pole could be virtually free of ice at the end of the summer as early as the 2030s, according to a recent study. Shrinking ice cover means not only the loss of hunting grounds of polar bears or resting places and nurseries for seals, but also of an entire under-ice ecosystem: meadows of filamentous ice algae, algae-grazing zooplankton, and juvenile polar cod, which find food and shelter in the cracks and crevices beneath the floes and, when grown up, feed larger predators such as ringed seals or beluga whales. In the short term, sea ice productivity could increase as more sunlight passes through thinner floes, boosting ice algae growth, but only as long as there is a sufficient supply of nutrients in the overall nutrient-poor central Arctic Ocean. The same goes for planktonic algae, or phytoplankton, which profit from higher light availability and a longer growth season in the expanding open-water areas, as satellite data shows. Changes in productivity and a shift from ice algae to phytoplankton at the base of the food web will probably have major effects on the marine ecosystem as whole. Also, the native flora and fauna are facing new competition from invasive species, from plankton to fish, that are moving in from the Atlantic and Pacific as the oceans warm.","meta":{"id":"environment/2024/feb/03/spoon-worms-lick-the-seabed-with-a-metre-long-tongue-a-voyage-into-a-vanishing-arctic-world_1","publication_date":"2024-02-03T11:00:14Z"}}

Regions near major rivers such as the Wear, Don, Calder, Derwent, Mersey and Irwell reported the wettest six-month period since records began. While January provided some respite, the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH) said the saturation from the previous months of heavy rain meant soil had not had a chance to dry out, and the high February rain meant problems persisted.
